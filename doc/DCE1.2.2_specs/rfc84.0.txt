                  DFS GATEWAY SUPPORT OF @SYS AND @HOST PER
                             NFS CLIENT MAPPINGS


   1. INTRODUCTION

      The DFS Gateway allows NFS clients to mount the exported DCE DFS
      namespace (rooted at `/.../') from an NFS client host, using a secure
      mechanism for the NFS client to obtain DCE credentials, as described
      in [MiSo].  When an NFS client accesses the DFS namespace through the
      DFS client, it uses the DFS client's values for `@sys' and `@host'.
      The `@sys' and `@host' values should represent the NFS client instead
      of the DFS client acting as the gateway.  This will let NFS clients
      of differing machine architectures share a single DFS gateway server.

      Adding the capability for NFS clients to have unique `@sys' and
      `@host' values requires that the DFS Gateway components `dfsgw',
      `dfsgwd' and `dfs_login' be modified.  In addition, the DFS cache-
      manager (CM) needs to be modified to use the appropriate `@sys' and
      `@host' values for the correct client -- local or remote NFS.


   2. TARGET

      This capability is for users of the DFS Gateway who wish to have the
      `@sys' and `@host' expansions match the NFS client system that they
      are using instead of the DFS Gateway machine.


   3. TERMINOLOGY

        (a) *@host*

            A syntactic token that can exist in a file or directory name
            that gets expanded to the hostname on lookup.

        (b) *@sys*

            A syntactic token that can exist in a file or directory name
            that gets expanded to the sysname on lookup.

        (c) *cache manager*

            The DFS cache-manager (CM).  It implements the client side of
            the DFS and (usually) resides in the system's OS kernel.

   OSF-RFC 84.0     DFS Gateway Support of @sys and @host         July 1995



        (d) *hostname*

            The hostname is (usually) the value returned by
            `gethostname(2)'.  It may be a fully qualified name (contains
            the domain).

        (e) *sysname*

            A unique name that describes the machine architecture and OS
            type.


   4. REQUIREMENTS

      This change will not affect the existing security model of the DFS
      Gateway.  It will require the revision of the DFSGW login protocol.
      DCE 1.1 `dfs_login' clients will interoperate with a new `dfsgwd',
      however the `@sys' and `@host' values will be defaulted.  The new
      `dfs_login' will interoperate with a DCE 1.1 `dfsgwd', but the old
      protocol will be used.  This will result in no `@sys' and `@host'
      assignment.


   5. FUNCTIONAL DEFINITION

      The components affected by adding this functionality are the DFS
      Gateway and the DFS cache-manager.

   5.1. Constructing a Sysname

      The default `@sys' value will be built into the `dfs_login' program
      for each system port that is done.  For systems that support
      `uname(2)', it will be used to provide the sysname.  The sysname is
      in the form of `<machine-class>_<os-release>':

        (a) The `<machine-class>' is a constant (e.g., `sun4'), based on
            the machine's CPU type.  On systems that support `uname(2)', it
            can be derived from the `utsname.machine' value.  Machine model
            details should not be used unless they are significant to
            identify a machine for running a class of executable files for
            that machine type.  For example if `utsname.machine' contains
            `hp725', the only relevant part would be `hp700'.

        (b) The `<os-release>' is made from the mnemonic name of the OS
            (e.g., `ux') and the OS release number.  When using `uname(2)',
            it can be derived from the `utsname.release' value.  Any
            leading zeros should be removed.

      If there are current definitions in DFS, then they should be used
      instead of this algorithm for consistency.




   J. Brezak                                                         Page 2







   OSF-RFC 84.0     DFS Gateway Support of @sys and @host         July 1995



      Here are some _examples_ of `@sys' names:

        (a) `i386_msdos'

        (b) `i386_winnt35'

        (c) `mac68k_macos7'

        (d) `hp700_ux905'

            NOTE: There should be a sysname registry.

   5.2. dfs_login Changes

      The `dfs_login' command will be modified to specify a sysname
      corresponding to the machine that it is running from.  It will use
      the `uname' method (as described in the previous section) if
      available on the machine's operating system.  Otherwise an
      alternative mechanism should be used, such as a compile-time default.

      The sysname can be overriden from the default value through the use
      of an environment variable `DFS_SYSNAME', or the command option `-S'.
      The command option will take precedence.

      The auth protocol version number will be changed to 2.  If the
      `dfsgwd' that the `dfs_login'/`dfs_logout' is trying to talk to
      doesn't support the new protocol, a fallback to the version 1
      protocol will occur.

   5.3. dfsgwd Changes

      The `dfsgwd' server will be changed to handle the new protocol.  It
      will also handle old protocol clients, but it will use a default
      sysname.

      These new options will be added:

        (a) `-sysname <name>'

        (b) `-nodomains'

      The default sysname will be that of the system that is running this
      instance of the `dfsgwd'.  This can be overridden by starting
      `dfsgwd' with the `-sysname <name>' argument.

      The hostname will be determined by the `dfsgwd' by doing a
      `gethostbyaddr(3)' on the source IP address in the protocol packet of
      the request.  The `-nodomains' options can be used to prune the
      domain part from the hostname.

   5.4. dfsgw Changes

      The `dfsgw' command will be changed to allow manipulation of the
      sysname and hostname fields in the auth database.

      These new command options will be added to the `add' command:

        (a) `-sysname <name>'

        (b) `-remotehost <name>'

      The `dfsgw' command will default the remote host option to that of
      the networkid specified in the `-id' option.  If the networkid is
      specified in dot-notation, the address will be resolved to a hostname
      before being used for the remotehost name.

      The default for the sysname will be to pass a zero length string in
      the syscall to perform the add operation.  The `at_add' syscall will
      use the default sysname for the DFS gateway machine in this case.

      In addition, the `list' command will be modified to display any
      `@sys' and `@host' values for each mapping.

   5.5. DFS Cache-Manager Changes

      The changes to the DFS cache manager require that the `cm_lookup()'
      operation be changed to query the AT database when either a `@sys' or
      `@host' component is encountered.  If the request is via the DFS
      Gateway and a mapping is found for the caller's PAG, the appropriate
      translation is returned.  If no mapping is found, then the machine's
      default (acting as the DFS GW) mappings are used.


   6. PROTOCOL CHANGES

      Version 2 of the auth request will be:

            u_char  DFSGW_PROTOCOL_VERSION = 2
            u_char  DFSGW_AUTH_PACKET = (1 << 1)
            unsigned  :0            /* pad to long boundary */
            u_long  dce_username_len
            char    dce_username<dce_username_len>
            unsigned  :0            /* pad to long boundary */
            u_long  networkAddrLen
            char    networkAddr<networkAddrLen>
            unsigned  :0            /* pad to long boundary */
            u_long  unix_uid
            unsigned  :0            /* pad to long boundary */
            u_long  sysname_len
            char    sysname<sysname_len>
            unsigned  :0            /* pad to long boundary */

   7. DATA STRUCTURES

      The auth database structure defining the PAG mappings will be
      modified to include the client sysname and hostname.

      /*
       * Mapping table entry, used in most AT syscalls.
       */
      typedef struct {
              struct sockaddr addr;
              uid_t uid;
              unsigned long pag;
              time_t expiration_time;
              char sysname[CM_MAXSYSNAME];
              char hostname[MAXHOSTNAMELEN];
      } at_pag_mapping_t;

            NOTE: A zero-length string in either the sysname or hostname
            will mean to use the default for that value.


   8. API'S

      The AFS_SYSCALL's for `AT_ADD' and `AT_LIST' for the DFS Gateway will
      now accept the expanded parameter list including the sysname and
      hostname.


   9. REMOTE INTERFACES

      There are no changes to remote interfaces.


   10. COMPATIBILITY

      The old and new versions of the DFS Gateway components will
      interoperate, but the new functionality will not be present.  This is
      accomplished by using the protocol version.  Clients will attempt to
      use the new version; if the server doesn't support this version an
      error will be returned.  This will cause the client to use the old
      version of the protocol.  The new server will support both the
      version 1 and (new) version 2 protocols.

      If the `dfsgw' server is presented with a request from a client whose
      protocol version it doesn't support, it will reply with an error code
      of `DFSGW_REPLY_ERROR_BAD_VERSION' (= 2).
