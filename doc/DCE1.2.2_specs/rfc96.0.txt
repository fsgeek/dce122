                   DFA: DISTRIBUTED FILE ACCESS MANAGER --
                           FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION


   1. INTRODUCTION

   1.1. Purpose

      Mainframes have been widely considered the most important form of
      company-wide information processing system for several decades,
      especially for critical applications.  However, due to rapid progress
      in the areas of hardware and network technology, workstation-based
      distributed systems have emerged as another means of handling such
      core operations.  OSF DCE, a de facto standard among distributed
      systems, is one of the most promising environments to offer a
      distributed system consisting of heterogeneous hardware and operating
      systems.  DCE DFS (Distributed File System), one of the DCE services,
      allows physically distributed files to be seen and accessed as a
      single logically-centralized file system.

      On the other hand, PCs are often used at department level in
      companies, and PC network systems, enabling file- and printer-
      sharing, predominate.  Novell's NetWare, with well over 60% of market
      share, dominates this field.

      As a result of this typical division of information resources, a
      great need has arisen for some way of making sharable the files used
      by the two kinds of system and allowing inter-department and intra-
      company file sharing.  The Distributed File-Access Manager (hereafter
      abbreviated as "DFA") is designed to meet this need.

      DFA provides a gateway function to access DFS files from a NetWare
      client, using the same operations as in NetWare.  This gateway
      function allows inter-department data sharing via DFS, and access to
      workstation DCE-based DFS files from PC clients.

   1.2. Features

      DFA has the following features:

        (a) DFS can be accessed with NetWare commands.

            DFA offers almost all of the fundamental file operations (such
            as assigning a DFS sub-directory to a DOS virtual drive, and
            file copying) using the identical equivalent NetWare commands.



   Hashimoto, Ito, Yamaura                                           Page 1







   OSF-RFC 96.0          DFA Functional Specification            April 1996



            In addition, DFA allows users to automatically log into DCE/DFS
            with NetWare login operations.  Users accessing DFS get the
            same "look and feel" as with NetWare.  (DFA does not, however,
            support access in the opposite direction, i.e., from a DFS
            client to NetWare files.)

        (b) DOS/Windows application programs can access DFS.

            Since DFA accesses DFS files using the NetWare client API, end
            users can access DFS files in the same manner as they would use
            to access NetWare files from DOS/Windows application programs.

        (c) Arbitrary portions of DFS can be accessed.

            DFA can define any portion of the DFS directory as a single
            NetWare volume, and this can be redefined as many times as
            desired.  Even if the target DFS is large and complex, a user
            can easily designate the target file.

        (d) Robust security.

            DFA has robust security: its authentication mechanism will not
            allow raw passwords to leak into network communications.  DFA
            employs an encryption key-based security.  Access rights to DFS
            files are checked and compared with users' authentication
            information.  Since DFA accesses DFS files using the access
            rights established for a user at DCE login, users get the
            advantage of robust file security via DFS's authorization
            checking.

        (e) High reliability.

            DFA is a highly reliable system with an error auditing process
            for periodic sanity checking, and it provides multiple means of
            recovery from system failures.

        (f) Ease of installation and scalability.

            DFA can be easily installed on an existing system without
            modification to DCE/DFS, the current NetWare file
            configuration, or the user's environment.  DFA is highly
            scalable and flexible: as a system grows, you simply add
            additional DFAs to balance the load.  (In order to be applied
            to large scale systems, additional instances of DFA must be
            multiplied for load balancing.)

   1.3. System Configuration

      The DFA system consists of PCs and workstations on which the NetWare
      client, NetWare server, DFS client, and DFSserver are running.  DFA's
      basic components are: a DFA gateway on a NetWare server, an
      Administration Utility, a DFA agent on a DFS client, and client
      utilities on a NetWare client.

      The DFA gateway is the component which provides most of the gateway
      functions.  Its primary purpose is to convert NetWare API calls into
      the equivalent DFS API calls.  These calls are then directed by the
      DFS agent to a DFS cache manager; the agent later returns the results
      of the calls to the DFA gateway.  The client utilities are a group of
      utility commands to concurrently log into DCE/DFS and NetWare.  The
      Administration Utility is a group of utilities which (among other
      things) performs the initialization of a DFA environment.

   1.4. Functional Overview

   1.4.1. DFS volume assignment

      DFA assigns an arbitrary portion of the DFS directory (hereafter
      called "DFS sub-directory") to a DFS volume created as a NetWare
      volume on NetWare (hereafter called "DFA Volume").  The DFS sub-
      directories can be mapped to multiple DFA volumes, and DFS sub-
      directories of different DCE cells can be assigned to multiple DFA
      volumes on a single NetWare server.  Actually, the DFA utility
      assigns and deletes the DFS sub-directories, and keeps track of the
      assignment/deletion history on the DFA volume table.  Prior to the
      assignment, DFS must have the sub-directory (mount point) assigned.

      Using NetWare's MAP command, any portion of the DFS sub-directory
      assigned to the DFA volume can be assigned to a drive in a NetWare
      client, and then accessed via redirection (see section 1.4.2 for
      details), using the same API as for NetWare files.

   1.4.2. Redirection

      After the DFA volume assignment, accesses to the DFA volume are
      redirected to the assigned DFS sub-directory.  The mechanism of
      redirection is that, on a NetWare server, NetWare file access API
      calls are hooked and converted into the equivalent DFS access.  The
      conversions are as follows:

        (a) Conversion of file/directory names.

            DFS file and directory names comply with UNIX naming
            conventions, which allow much longer names than does DOS.  DFA
            converts DFS file and directory names into DOS form in such a
            way as to prevent the converted names' matching any already-
            existing DOS file or directory names.



   Hashimoto, Ito, Yamaura                                           Page 3







   OSF-RFC 96.0          DFA Functional Specification            April 1996



        (b) Conversion of trustees/attributes.

            ACLs (Access Control Lists) control access rights to DFS.  DFA
            converts ACLs to NetWare trustees, and sets default values for
            the NetWare file attributes (DFS does not have "file
            attributes").

        (c) Conversion of file locking protocols.

            DFA mutually converts the locking protocols of NetWare and DFS.
            DFA does not, however, support record-level (or lower-level)
            locking.

   1.4.3. Automatic DCE login

      The DFA login utility allows automatic and simultaneous login to
      DCE/DFS whenever a user logs into NetWare.  Even though NetWare and
      DCE/DFS do not have the equivalent user ID and password, a user can
      simultaneously login to both NetWare and DCE/DFS with a single
      operation, provided that mapping of user IDs and passwords is
      enabled.

   1.4.4. Multiple DFA agent support

      If there are multiple DFA agents, the DFA gateway automatically
      selects a DFA agent to which to connect.  This provides both for
      resource redundancy in case of system failure, and load balancing.

   1.4.5. System error monitoring and recovery

        (a) File access error.

            Whenever a file access error occurs, DFA retries the access.
            If the error occurs a second time, DFA terminates the job.  To
            ensure that files in such cases are not left opened and
            unusable, the file is closed and the connection terminated.

        (b) Error auditing.

            Both the DFA gateway and the agent audit errors.  Whenever an
            error is detected, DFA issues a report, and initiates error
            recovery procedures.

        (c) DFA agent switching.

            As mentioned above in section 1.4.4, to provide seamless
            operation, DFA will automatically switch from a malfunctioning
            to a correctly-operating agent.

   2. GENERAL CONCEPTS OF DFA

      DFA's primary purpose is to allow a PC user to easily take advantage
      of DCE DFS file access via his or her NetWare environment, and thus
      transform a mainframe-centered into a company-wide distributed
      system.  In order for users to be able to handle DFS files in the
      same manner as NetWare files, DFA supports various file sharing and
      mapping functions.

      DFA is highly expandable.  NetWare can access DFS files only if a
      NetWare server and DFS client are equipped with DFA modules, and are
      connected with TCP/IP.  Since DCE authenticates NetWare users with
      DCE's Kerberos, a NetWare user can access DFS files without
      diminishing the robustness of DCE security.

      Possessing only a NetWare user ID, a user can simultaneously log into
      NetWare and DCE with a single simple operation.  Users are
      automatically able to access files in both systems, NetWare and DFS,
      using the same commands and the same programs.

      DFA also provides utilities for system error auditing, error
      analysis, error recovery, and system administration.

   2.1. File Sharing and Mapping

   2.1.1. Assignment of DFS file to netware volume

      DFA enables a PC user connected to a NetWare server to handle the DFS
      file system (hereafter called DFS) as if those files resided in
      NetWare.  Users can access DFS files with the same operations as they
      would PC files.  Since users on different NetWare servers can share
      and access the same DFS files, NetWare can be expanded into a
      company-wide file sharing system.

      A DFA administrator can pick as a mount point any arbitrary directory
      under the DFS junction (`fs'), and assign all the files and
      directories under the specified mount point (collectively called "DFS
      sub-directory") to a NetWare volume (see section 2.6 for details;
      prior to making this assignment, the DFS administrator needs to
      create the DFS sub-directories).  The NetWare volume to which the DFS
      sub-directory is assigned, is called a "DFA volume".  DFA reproduces
      on the DFA volume the DFS sub-directory's directory structure, using
      dummy (i.e., zero-length) files to represent on the DFA volume the
      original DFS sub-directory files.  Users access the DFS files by
      using the DFA volume and file name (i.e., a directory path name).

      A DFS sub-directory whose DCE cell is different from the one
      connected to DFA can also be assigned to a DFA volume.  Moreover, DFA
      administrators for different NetWare servers can independently assign
      the same DFS sub-directory.




   Hashimoto, Ito, Yamaura                                           Page 5







   OSF-RFC 96.0          DFA Functional Specification            April 1996



   2.1.2. Volume redirection

      By designating a DFA volume name, users can access DFS files in the
      same way as they would a NetWare server volume.  If a directory (of
      the user's choice) in the DFA volume is mapped to the client's
      virtual disk drive using NetWare MAP commands, the user can create,
      delete, and rename the files and directories in the DFA volume as
      well as read and write the files.

      When a DFA agent redirects access to a DFS file, DFA preserves
      compatibility between DOS and DFS file access by doing the following:

        (a) NetWare file API calls are translated into DFS file API calls.

        (b) NetWare names are converted into DFS file names.

        (c) NetWare trustees are converted into DFS file access rights.

        (d) DFS file locking is performed.

        (e) DFS files are cached on a NetWare server.

   2.1.3. API conversion

      Conversion of NetWare file API calls into DFS API calls allows users
      to manipulate DFS files and directories in the same manner as they
      would NetWare files and directories.

      DFA hooks (via a machine's operating system) into the NetWare file
      I/O operations.  Whenever a requested operation is on a DFS file or
      directory, DFA converts the operation request into the equivalent DFS
      file access call, and sends the converted DFS call to the DFA
      gateway, which in turn sends it on to DFS.

      When the operation completes, the DFA agent sends back to the DFA
      gateway the operation's (DFS file access) return code, having first
      converted the code into its NetWare equivalent.

      Note that the API conversion process does not include automatic
      conversion of text, such as DOS and UNIX linefeed codes.

   2.1.4. File name conversion

      Basically, a DFA user creates a DOS file on a DFA volume.  A NetWare
      user can access all files in the assigned DFS sub-directory, whether
      they were created after the assignment or were already present when
      the assignment to a DFA volume was made.  If a given DFS file name
      does not comply with DOS's file naming rules (i.e., 8 or fewer
      characters followed optionally by a dot and 3 extension characters),
      DFA converts the DFS file name into a DOS-like name.  It does this
      using a set of rules which conform to the X/Open PC Internetworking



   Hashimoto, Ito, Yamaura                                           Page 6







   OSF-RFC 96.0          DFA Functional Specification            April 1996



      PC-NFS Specification, appending keys so that the converted names
      remain distinct.

      Re-conversion from the converted DOS file name back to the original
      DFS file name proceeds by: (1) selecting the DFS file names likeliest
      to have been the original; (2) converting these into DOS names and
      comparing the conversions with the DOS file name to be reconverted;
      and (3) matching one of these with the candidate for reconversion

   2.1.5. File access mapping between netware and DFS

      Using only the rights acquired by logging into NetWare, a user can
      access DFS files without having to login to DCE.  DFA maintains a
      table which maps user names registered to NetWare to those registered
      to DCE, and uses this (and the DFS ACLs) to check users' access
      rights to DFS files.  NetWare users can acquire the access rights
      that belong to the DCE group to which their corresponding DCE user
      name belongs.  If, however, a user has the access rights both of a
      DCE user and of a DCE group, the latter is ignored.

      DFA makes no conversion between NetWare and DFS groups.  Thus, a
      NetWare group access right cannot be applied to DFS files and
      directories.  See Section 2.6.1 for information on administering user
      names and group names.

      A user, using DFA utilities, can set and reference access rights
      values for DFS files and directories in the DFA volume with the same
      commands as used for the corresponding NetWare operations.

      DFA converts ACL values (i.e., access rights to DFS) to and from
      trustee (NetWare) values.  NetWare files also have attributes such as
      "read only" and "purge".  However, since such attributes cannot be
      mapped to DFS files, DFA does not convert them.  Instead, DFA
      displays default values when the attribute of a DFS file is requested
      by a NetWare user.

      The conversion between ACL and trustee values is such that, from the
      user's (or rather, application program's) point of view, NetWare and
      DFS have virtually equivalent access rights for files and
      directories.  Since NetWare supports "inherited right masks" but DFS
      does not, DFA does not map the masks.

   2.1.6. File locking

      In order to permit users connected to different servers to share
      files, DFA can lock the shared files in DFS.  DFA, however, only
      supports implicit file locking.  In other words, DFA will lock a DFS
      file if an application opened the file in "write mode", and releases
      the lock when the file is closed.





   Hashimoto, Ito, Yamaura                                           Page 7







   OSF-RFC 96.0          DFA Functional Specification            April 1996



      There are two ways to lock a DFS file: mandatory locking and advisory
      locking.  DFA uses mandatory locking.  This is because NetWare itself
      supports only mandatory locking, and a file locked by a NetWare user
      should be locked from access by a DFS user.  If, however, the DFS
      server operating system does not support mandatory locking, DFA is
      able to employ advisory locking instead.

   2.1.7. File caching

      By caching a DFS file onto a NetWare server, DFA's DFS file access
      speed can be made to approach that of file access on a NetWare
      server.  In particular, a user can take advantage of this feature
      when a DFA gateway is sited far from the DFA agent.

   2.2. Expandability

      DFA provides the following expandability to allow users to build a
      company-wide network by expanding existing NetWare servers:

        (a) Adding NetWare users.

            A DFA agent on a DFS client can handle multiple DFA gateways.
            Thus, the number of NetWare users that can concurrently access
            DFS files can be increased by adding NetWare servers that have
            DFA gateways.  Each NetWare server has the maximum number of
            login users, and the number of the total DCE users is
            determined by each DCE.

        (b) Adding NetWare servers.

            There is no limit to the number of NetWare servers that can be
            connected to a DFS client.  If performance deterioration occurs
            (such as can happen when, for example, a single DFS client
            handles too many NetWare servers), a user has only to add a DFS
            client, and connect some of the NetWare servers to the new
            client.  Bottlenecks can be easily eliminated without changing
            the current environment.

        (c) Adding DFA volumes.

            The total number of NetWare and DFA volumes per NetWare server
            must be 64 or less.  However, there is no limit to the number
            of DFS sub-directories that can be assigned to a DFA volume.
            Thus, by adding a NetWare server equipped with a DFA gateway to
            a LAN, a user can virtually augment the effective number of DFA
            volumes.

        (d) NetWare interoperability.

            DFA uses the standard NetWare functions.  To the extent that
            new versions of NetWare maintain backward compatibility, DFA



   Hashimoto, Ito, Yamaura                                           Page 8







   OSF-RFC 96.0          DFA Functional Specification            April 1996



            will continue to run the new versions.

        (e) DFS interoperability.

            DFA uses the standard DFS functions.  To the extent that new
            versions of DFS maintain backward compatibility, DFA will
            continue to run on new versions.

   2.3. Security

      DFA offers two types of security mechanism: authentication, which
      ensures that only properly-qualified users can log into DCE; and file
      access rights, which control DFS file access based on a set of access
      rights granted to a user.  This section describes authentication (see
      also "access right control").

      In order to access DFS files via DFA, a user needs to log into (1) a
      NetWare server equipped with a DFA gateway (in order to access a DFA
      gateway), and (2) DCE (in order to access DFS).  DFA enables a user
      to login to both with a single operation, and without having to enter
      a DCE password, greatly simplifying the login operation.

      DFA has a login utility for both the DOS and the Windows environment,
      and this utility provides a login environment at the same level as
      the NetWare login.  At login time, users can select whether or not
      they will also login simultaneously to DCE.  (A user who has chosen
      to login only to NetWare can subsequently elect to log into DCE by
      invoking the login utility.)

      On a NetWare client, when the login utility receives a user's login
      request, it first accomplishes the login to NetWare, then (if
      specified) proceeds to do a DCE login via a DFA gateway.  With this
      method, the user has to specify the NetWare server on which the DFA
      gateway is running.  When a user logs into DCE, the login utility (in
      fact a DFA gateway) searches the bindery information on the NetWare
      server, and selects the DCE user name that corresponds to the NetWare
      user name.

      A NetWare password can be different from the DCE password.  A DFA
      administrator can set the DCE password to the NetWare bindery
      beforehand.  See Section 2.6.1 for information on how DCE user names
      and passwords are registered.

      In order for DCE to retain its security level with DFA in operation,
      it is necessary to make sure there is no password leakage (especially
      via wire tapping), and also that the DFA gateway is authorized to be
      connected to DCE.

      To prevent illegal access by unauthorized clients, DFA gateways and
      agents communicate with each other using Kerberos.  DFA agents have
      the full functionality of a Kerberos client, and DFA gateways also



   Hashimoto, Ito, Yamaura                                           Page 9







   OSF-RFC 96.0          DFA Functional Specification            April 1996



      have a subset of Kerberos capability.  When authentication occurs
      between a DFA agent and client, no "raw passwords" are sent over the
      wire.  NetWare servers store DCE passwords in their bindery, and raw
      DCE passwords are not transmitted when users login.

   2.4. Compatibility

      In order to make it as easy as possible to use, DFA inherits PC
      operations such as displaying file contents, and copying/searching
      files.  In addition, DFA allows use of DOS/Windows application
      programs, enabling users to smoothly migrate to a DFA-based company-
      wide network.

      DFA's goal is to allow PC application programs to manipulate DFS
      files in the same manner as local (PC) files.  In this sense, DFA
      guarantees the compatibility of NetWare commands with DFS file
      operations; however, it should be borne in mind that not all of
      NetWare's original utility commands will necessarily work with DFS.
      The following list specifies the kinds and degrees of cross-
      compatibility that can and cannot be expected from DFA.

        (a) Interface compatibility.

            DFA compatibility is guaranteed for the following interfaces:

              (i) The file access APIs provided by DOS and Windows.

             (ii) Operation interfaces provided by Windows utilities that
                  use the above interfaces.

        (b) Interface non-compatibility.

            DFA compatibility is not guaranteed for the following
            interfaces:

              (i) NetWare client and NLM file access APIs.

             (ii) Operation interfaces provided by utilities that use the
                  above interfaces.

      Compatibility is accomplished in the following manner (see Section
      3.2.2 for details): requests for file access and trustee access via
      the DOS/Windows API are handled by the corresponding routines of a
      NetWare server; a DFA gateway hooks into these routines, and
      translates them into the appropriate DFS file access requests.

   2.5. Error Handling

   2.5.1. Error detection

      This functionality detects DFA errors, allowing users to take the
      proper action to recover from the error condition.  When critical
      errors occur in a DFA agent or DFA gateway (for example, a DFA agent
      crash), DFA displays an error message at the consoles of the agent's
      and gateway's host machines.

   2.5.2. Error analysis

      This functionality analyzes the causes of hardware errors, program
      errors and user errors, so that users can avoid repeating the errors.

   2.5.3. Error recovery

      This functionality assists quick and easy recovery from system faults
      caused by errors.  If a DFA gateway is connected to multiple DFA
      agents, and one of the DFA agents communicating with the DFA gateway
      fails, this function automatically connects the DFA gateway to a
      different DFA agent so that a user can continue the current jobs.
      Note, however, that DFA does not support automatic recovery of file
      that was open on a failed gateway.

      DFA provides for automatic restart of DFA agents by registering them
      with a DFS "overseer" process (BOS Server).

   2.6. DFA Administration

      The DFA-specific administrative task is called DFA administration.
      In order to distinguish a DFS administrator from a NetWare
      administrator, the person who administers DFA is called a DFA
      administrator.  A DFA administrator and a NetWare administrator can
      be the same person.  The DFA administrator performs DFA
      administrative tasks from the console of a NetWare server.  NetWare
      supervisor mode is required.  Using NetWare's remote console, a DFA
      administrator can also perform DFA administrative tasks from a
      NetWare client PC.  The details of DFA administration are as follows:

   2.6.1. User information administration

      DFA maps between NetWare and DCE user names so that NetWare users can
      access DFS files.

      A utility program appends DCE information (e.g., DCE password, DCE
      user ID) to the NetWare user object, which thus holds information
      about the DCE properties of the user's DCE user ID.  A "DFA user" is
      defined as a user who has such a NetWare/DCE user name mapping.  DFA
      also provides a utility program that displays the NetWare and DCE
      user name mappings.



   Hashimoto, Ito, Yamaura                                          Page 11







   OSF-RFC 96.0          DFA Functional Specification            April 1996



      However, DFA does not support simultaneous user name registration to
      DCE and NetWare, nor does it support simultaneous password change in
      DCE and NetWare.

      DFA has a utility program that groups DFA users into a DCE user
      group.  This allows users to set the same access rights for multiple
      users.  The following groups exist:

        (a) EVERYONE group.

        (b) User group.

      The EVERYONE group includes all the DFA user names in the same
      NetWare server.  A User group is a group of DCE users who are
      eligible to access the same certain DFS directories and files.  A
      User group can be specified, and access rights set for it, in NetWare
      form.

      DFA does not map between already-existing NetWare groups and DCE
      groups.  This is because both groups contain non-DFA users, and it
      makes no sense to map between them.

      DFA registers a DFA user's DCE password with the bindery on a NetWare
      server, but it does nothing with the DFA user's NetWare password.

   2.6.2. Volume administration

      The DFA administrator, using a NetWare utility, can create a DFA
      volume and assign a DFS sub-directory to the DFA volume.  DFA
      displays a directory listing of the DFS file system so that the
      administrator can easily assign the DFS volume.  The "original" files
      in a DFA volume, unlike original NetWare files, reside in a sub-
      directory of DFS.  Since DFS cannot administer the space of a DFS
      sub-directory, and multiple NetWare administrators can independently
      assign DFS sub-directories, DFA does not administer the DFA volume
      space.

      If necessary, a DFA administrator can "un-assign" the DFA volume from
      the DFS sub-directory, and, using a NetWare utility, delete the DFA
      volume.

      To use the DFA volume, a user needs to mount the volume onto NetWare
      using NetWare's mount command, and start DFA.  When a user terminates
      DFA, the DFA volume can be released from NetWare using NetWare's
      dismount command.  NetWare's batch file function enables users to
      execute such series of operations with a single command.

      The DFA utility displays the following volume information:

        (a) Volume names.




   Hashimoto, Ito, Yamaura                                          Page 12







   OSF-RFC 96.0          DFA Functional Specification            April 1996



        (b) Names of DFS sub-directories assigned to the volumes.

      The DFA administrator, using the DFS back-up utility, can backup the
      DFS sub-directories onto DFS.  The back-up size is by DFS file set
      (which corresponds to a UNIX file partition).  The DFS backup utility
      does not support the remote execution of DFS backup from a NetWare
      client, or backup of DFS files onto NetWare.

   2.6.3. DCE connection and disconnection

      The DFS administrator starts a DFA agent (as a daemon) on the same
      UNIX machine as the DFS client when starting up the system.  The DFA
      administrator registers a DFA agent's IP address and hostname to the
      `SYS:ETC$B%H(BOST' file in NetWare.  The DFA gateway specifies the IP
      address of the DFA agent, and has a connection with it.  A DFA
      gateway can connect and disconnect to a DFA agent while DFS is
      running.

   2.6.4. Auditing

      DFA administrators can use audit functions provided by both DFS and
      NetWare.  DFA, however, does not provide any new functionality to
      integrate the two auditing functions.

   2.6.5. Accounting

      Although DFA does not provide an accounting utility, NetWare's
      accounting utility (which reports server connect time, number of
      blocks read, number of blocks written, etc.) can be used on a DFA
      volume.  However, the utility cannot report on disk utilization of
      DFA sub-directories.

   2.7. System and Software Configuration

      DFA consists of the following components:

        (a) DFA gateway (NLM on NetWare server).

        (b) DFA administration utility (NLM on NetWare server).

        (c) DFA agent (an application program on a DFS client machine).

        (d) Client utility (an application program on a NetWare client
            machine).

      The following table shows the software required to run DFA (in its
      reference implementation -- other ports are beyond the scope of this
      RFC):

                        Table 1. Prerequisite Software

      In order to reduce its size on a NetWare server machine, DFA is split
      into two parts: a DFA gateway sited on a NetWare server machine, and
      a DFA agent located on a DFA client machine.  Although this method
      requires that the DFS file access requests re-directed by a DFA
      gateway be sent to a DFA agent through the communication channel
      between a NetWare server and DFA client, the NetWare server machine
      has only to carry a conversion program between NetWare and DFS in
      order to reduce the load on the server machine.

      Another alternative is to embed the functions of the DFS client on
      the NetWare server machine.  The advantage of this method is that the
      DFS side does not need additional software.  However, since the
      software required to outfit the NetWare server machine is huge, DFA
      does not employ this method.

   2.7.1. Login utility

      A NetWare client machine contains the client utilities, including a
      login utility which logs into NetWare and DCE.  This section
      describes how the login utility is implemented.

      DFA DCE login requires the following two steps:

        (a) The login request is issued from a NetWare client to a DFA
            gateway on a NetWare server.





   Hashimoto, Ito, Yamaura                                          Page 14







   OSF-RFC 96.0          DFA Functional Specification            April 1996



            There are two ways to implement this first step: (1) a server
            catches the login request sent from a client; or (2) a NetWare
            client provides a different login utility to send the login
            request to a DFA gateway.  Since NetWare does not currently
            provide the detection means necessary for implementing (1), the
            method (2) is employed.

        (b) The DFA gateway logs into DCE.

            This second step can be implemented if the NetWare server
            machine has a client portion of the DCE security service
            installed (i.e., Kerberos authentication).  This method,
            however, as was mentioned above, increases the load on the
            NetWare server.  Instead therefore, in DFA the client
            functionality of the DCE security service is split and embedded
            in the DFA agent and DFA gateway.

      Similarly to NLM on a NetWare server machine, DFA provides the
      following administration utilities:

        (a) Volume assignment (assigning a DFS sub-directory to a DFA
            volume).

        (b) User management (mapping NetWare and DCE user names).

        (c) Access rights management (mapping file access rights between
            NetWare and DFS).

   2.8. Internationalization

      DFA, using NetWare's enabling service, provides internationalization.
      For the following items, DFA refers to the "locale," to provide the
      locally correct value:

        (a) Character code.

        (b) Numeric.

        (c) Dates.

        (d) Time.

      The localized messages are supplied in a message file, separate from
      the DFA source code.  DFA is shipped with the message file
      appropriate to the destination's locale.
