The DocBook 2.4 DTD was compiled and installed at OSF on an HP-UX version
10.10 platform using the ArborText ADEPT Document Architect 5.0.2
software (the ``bigdocarch'' version was used in order to accommodate
the very large DCE books).

The DTD and FOSI were compiled from the following source files, which
are included in this directory:

DocBook.dtd

 Document type definition (DTD) file. The following files contain various
 ingredients of the DTD and are compiled with it:

   docbook.dcl

   SGML declaration file. For ADEPT Document Architect 5.0.2 the contents
   of this file had to be inserted into the top of DocBook.dtd in order
   to successfully compile the latter. You will need to retain a separate copy
   of this file if you intend to run the docbook-to-man conversion program.

   calstbl.mod

     CALS table document type definition.

   dbgenent.mod

     DocBook additional general entities.

   dbhier.mod

     DocBook document hierarchy module V2.4.
 
   dbpool.mod

     DocBook information pool module V2.4.

DocBook.atd

 Auxiliary tag definition file.

docbook.cat

 DocBook catalog data V2.4. You will need this file if you intend
 to run the docbook-to-man conversion program.

docbook.lcl

 Auxiliary FOSI file.

DocBook.fos

 OSF ``publish'' style FOSI source.

draft.fos

 OSF ``draft'' style FOSI source.

pubrc

 ADEPT DocBook instance initialization file. This file must
 be present in order to allow ADEPT to choose between
 ``draft'' or ``publish'' style formatting at the beginning of
 an editing session on an SGML document.
