This directory contains the SGML source and importable Encapsulated     
Postscript graphics files necessary to generate the "OSF DCE/File-Access
Administration Guide and Reference".

The wrapper file is dfa_admin_gdref.sgml, and this file references the
other component parts of the document as file entities, specifically:

preface
adminchap1
adminchap2
adminchap3
adminchap4
adminchap5
adminchap6
adminchap7
appendixA

The *.eps and *.aep files in the eps subdirectory are Encapsulated
Postscript graphics; you can see where they go in the book by looking
in the Chapter source files for the <Graphic> string.

The PostScript output file is:

  <dce1.2.2-doc-dir>/src/dce_books_sgml/dfa_admin_gdref/Output/ps/
