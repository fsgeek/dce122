<Para>For the purposes of the discussion in this chapter, the security services
provided by DCE are assumed to consist of three elements: authentication,
access control, and data protection.  (The DCE Audit Service, which is also a
<IndexTerm Id="ADGISG.SECUR.indx.1">

</IndexTerm>part of DCE security, is described in the &DCEDk;.)
</Para>
<Para>The roles of these three elements can be broadly defined as follows

</ItemizedList>
<Para><?sml-need 10>As with other DCE services, use of the security services raise two kinds of
policy questions.  At one level, application programmers must decide which
services and levels of service to employ.  At a second level, once a service
has been chosen, the application programmer must make many decisions about
how to use it.  This chapter covers both levels of policy, although it focuses
mainly on the lower-level policy issues specific to each service.  This emphasis
is due both to the fact that the higher-level issues are relatively 
few&mdash;mainly whether to use a given service or not&mdash;and to the belief that it
is far easier to understand the general issues once the specifics are clear.
</Para>
<Para>Security is an especially complex area from the policy point of view.
Security systems must anticipate threats both from human ingenuity and
random accident, and it can be difficult&mdash;perhaps impossible&mdash;to
be confident that no serious threat is being overlooked.  DCE
security provides an extensive security model that applications can
incorporate in a few well-integrated chunks.  Thus applications can
get the benefit of the DCE security design&mdash;and the extensive,
specialized analysis that went into it&mdash;with relatively little
effort.  Applications should avoid creating security solutions <Replaceable>ad
hoc</Replaceable> and should stick closely to the solutions provided by DCE
security.  Unless the programmer is a security specialist, it is
extremely unlikely that an application-specific solution will provide
better security than the DCE security services, and it is practically
guaranteed that such solutions will contain unforeseen weaknesses.

</IndexTerm>
<Para>At a high level, the DCE security model is as follows.
Servers specify the authentication service they use (currently either
none or DCE secret key).  Clients request an authentication
service (which may be none) when making a call.  When a server
specifies an authentication service, it is specifying the service it
<IndexTerm Id="ADGISG.SECUR.indx.6">
<Primary>authentication</Primary>
<Secondary>requested by client</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>will use <Replaceable>if authentication is requested by the client</Replaceable>.  This allows a
server to permit both authenticated and unauthenticated access.  When
a client requests authentication and the server provides it,
authentication is carried out silently by the runtime as part of the
RPC protocol.  The runtime will fail the call if the client cannot be

<Primary>authentication</Primary>
<Secondary>not requested by client</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>

performed.  If the client requests authentication and the server does
not provide it, the runtime will fail the call.

<Para>Authentication establishes only that each of the parties is

</IndexTerm>authorization decision using one of the DCE authorization services,
to decide whether a given authenticated principal should in fact be
granted access to some operation or resource.  In most cases, clients
will not be satisfied with the mere assurance that they are communicating
with an authenticated principal.  Clients must then check the authenticated
<IndexTerm Id="ADGISG.SECUR.indx.16">
<Primary>authentication</Primary>
<Secondary>how often performed</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>identity of the server to be sure that it is one with which they are
willing to communicate.  Note that this kind of server identity check
is normally made at a low level of granularity: typically once per

<IndexTerm Id="ADGISG.SECUR.indx.25">
<Primary>data protection</Primary>
<Secondary>supported levels of</Secondary>

guarantees.  The basic model is that the client application requests 
the minimum acceptable protection level.  The runtime then provides
the lowest supported protection level that is <Replaceable>at least</Replaceable> as high
as the one requested by the client.  If the runtime cannot provide
at least the requested level, it fails the call.  Supported levels
as well as the services provided by each level depend on the authentication
service in use, so clients must take care to request a level that is
meaningful for the authentication service they have specified.

authentication is sufficiently abstract that an alternative
authentication protocol can be implemented.  However, given that none
so far has been implemented, it would be difficult to define
protocol-independent authentication policies based on a realistic
understanding of the behavior of alternate authentication services or
the as yet unspecified programmer's interface to such services.  The
policy recommendations of this section do, therefore, make the
assumption that Kerberos is the underlying authentication protocol.
No guarantees can be given as to their appropriateness if an
alternative authentication protocol is implemented.

sense, the fundamental data of authentication.  The basic
authentication policy issues therefore have to do with how
applications manipulate this data: how they acquire their principal
identities and how they maintain the security of their secret keys.
This section discusses these questions.
The following discussion assumes an understanding of the basic
transactions of the Kerberos protocol as implemented by DCE.  That is,

<CiteTitle>AES/DC Security</CiteTitle> volume.  It does not assume
that you know anything about the details of protocol encoding,
encryption mechanisms, and so on. 
</Para>
<Para>At a very general level, authentication (Kerberos)-related activity
takes place in three stages:

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Some <Replaceable>application-level actions</Replaceable> are then required of the client
and server principals: fundamentally, the client must obtain validated
credentials, and the server must point the RPC runtime to the storage
for its keys.  Note that, strictly speaking, the server need not
itself obtain any credentials, as these are only used by the client of
the Kerberos exchange.  However, since servers typically must also act
as clients (of the name service, for example), they will normally also
need to acquire credentials.
</Para>
<Para>In the case of the client, the application-level actions
required to obtain credentials are normally carried out
by a login program before the client is run, and the client inherits
valid credentials.  Therefore, this stage of activity is not usually
carried out explicitly by clients.  In the case of the server, these
activities are usually carried out by the server explicitly.  The
reasons for this difference are one of the topics covered in the
discussion that follows.

decisions based on the assumption that authentication has been carried
out, but these belong more properly to the realm of authorization, as
described in Section 3.4.
</Para>
<Para>Note that the application code proper need only concern itself
with item 2 in the above list.  This item is therefore the appropriate
realm for policy recommendations about application-level
authentication.  Item 1 is an administrative task required for the
installation and maintainance of the application.  Nevertheless, the
required administrative actions depend on how the application treats
authentication and are, therefore, indirectly a policy concern for the
application programmer.  What this policy guide recommends is
essentially a standard application security model that results in a
standard administrative task.  Note that, once the administrative and
application setup covered by items 1 and 2 have been performed, item
3 is handled transparently by the RPC runtime.

<Para>One of the obvious conclusions to be drawn from the general discussion
of DCE authentication is that application-level client and server

</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 10>From the RPC point of view, the basic model is that servers are
persistent entities in the sense that they normally perform services
on behalf of more than one client principal session.  This may mean that
servers are persistent in time: that is, that they run for a
long time, possibly for as long as the machine they are running on is
up and running.  But even servers that are invoked on demand (and
therefore that run for a short period of time) can be invoked by multiple
clients and, during their short lives, may well perform services for
clients other than the invoker.

persistent client can easily be written that assumes its own identity,
manages keys, and acquires and updates credentials.  The
basic authentication policies described here can be easily extended to
cover this case.

</Para>
<Para>For a client that runs with an inherited identity, the principal
security problem&mdash;the maintainance of its secrets&mdash;is reduced to
the problem of maintaining the security of its credentials while they
are valid.  The client is basically passive in this respect, depending
on the local operating system to prevent unauthorized access to the
credential cache of the DCE principal that initiates the client
application.  Direct management and discovery of keys (for example,
reading them from a configuration file) is not required of such clients.
Typically, such an application can do nothing about the security of the
principal's keys used to acquire credentials, since all the
authentication-related state is inherited.  The client's real security
responsibility is therefore negative: not to take any action outside
of the specified authentication policy model that could compromise
security for the identity with which it runs (for example,
indiscriminately giving other processes access to its credentials).
</Para>
<Para><FootnoteRef Linkend="ADGISG.SECUR.footn.1"><!--WARNING: containment may be wrong-->
</FootnoteRef>Clients may or may not be concerned with the identities of the servers
they call.  The Kerberos authentication exchange is mutual in the
sense that both clients and servers must have genuine authentication
identities to participate successfully.  However, a client may not
trust a server simply because it can successfully authenticate to the
client.  The client may want to make RPCs only to servers with specific
principal identities that it trusts.  In this case, the client has the
additional security task of safely maintaining a list of acceptable
server identities with which it is willing to communicate.
<Footnote Id="ADGISG.SECUR.footn.1">
<Para>This is another of the basic asymmetries of the Kerberos-based security
mechanism.  Servers can control client access by demanding that the
client be authenticated and then making authorization
decisions based on the client's authenticated privilege attributes.
Clients can only require that the servers they call be authenticated.
This leaves the client with three server authentication options:

<IndexTerm Id="ADGISG.SECUR.indx.41">
<Primary>keys</Primary>
<Secondary>maintenance of by server</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>DCE secret key authentication protocol is the maintainance of keys.
This depends on local operating system access control to the key
<IndexTerm Id="ADGISG.SECUR.indx.42">
<Primary><Literal>keytab</Literal> file</Primary>
</IndexTerm>storage (typically a so-called <Literal>keytab</Literal> file) for the DCE
principal identity used by the server.  However, since servers
normally also need to acquire credentials (in order to behave as
clients of other services), application programmers need to think
carefully about how the server identity is acquired.  In general, it
is not satisfactory to have servers run with credentials inherited
from human logins.  For one thing, this requires the server to share
keys with human users.  This means that the server either needs to
have access to the default key storage used by human principals
(typically the default <Literal>keytab</Literal> file, probably owned by root) or
<IndexTerm Id="ADGISG.SECUR.indx.43">
<Primary>keys</Primary>
<Secondary>local copies of user keys</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>it needs to keep separate copies of user keys in local storage.  Both
of these schemes decrease the security of keys, and the latter makes
key management difficult.
</Para>
<Para>A straightforward scheme that meets these requirements is to have the
server identity supplied by the invoker (or a configuration file) and
have the server assume this identity via a series of security service
calls.  The only administrative overhead is in establishing at least one
principal and the required <Literal>keytab</Literal> file.  This is typically handled through
<Literal>dced</Literal> facilities.

this.  Indeed, it is the cardinal fact of DCE security that, on any

which it runs.  It is therefore a sound policy to make this dependency
explicit rather than erecting an illusory layer of DCE security on top

</IndexTerm>Name-based authorization is straightforward, but of very limited utility.  In
the simplest form, the application compares the extracted name string with a
set of permitted names.  However, the application is entirely responsible for
maintaining and manipulating the set of permitted names securely, which is a nontrivial
task.  For example, the application must provide for some administrative way to
update the set of permitted users.  Typically, this will require maintainance of
a restricted access file in some application-specific format.  This is the kind
of administrative overhead that applications should be designed to avoid.

organizations associated with access privileges).  Since the credential-based (ACL)

<Para>As their names suggest (full descriptions can be found in the

and so on.
</Para>
<Para>A properly-set-up DCE application does not have to implement any of these
operations; they are all taken care of by the remote ACL implementations
in the DCE ACL library.  The only exception to this statement involves the

implementations: the registered routine will always be called during a
binding operation on any of the application's ACLs, and once it has given
the library a binding to the desired ACL, the library routines can perform
any requested operation with it.

<Para>You might think that only one database would be required to hold the object
state information described above.  Why, then, are three backing store databases
employed in the sample application? The answer to this question has two parts.
</Para>
<Para>First: It is true that only one database is needed to hold the object state
information itself.  The need for a second database arises from the necessity
of organizing the object information in more than one way, so that it can be
retrieved both by name and by object UUID.  The object information is stored
directly in a database indexed by object UUIDs, and that is how it must be
retrieved.  However, application users will specify resources by names, not
UUIDs.  In order to make this work, the application stores its objects' UUIDs
in a separate database indexed by their names.  Thus any object's information
can be retrieved, if the object's name is known, by means of a two-step
process involving (first) looking up an object UUID from the name-indexed
database, and (second) looking up the object information from the object
UUID-indexed database.
</Para>
<Para>Secondly: There is a third database to hold only the objects' ACLs.
Theoretically speaking, there is no reason why the ACLs couldn't be held
with the rest of the objects' information, in the object UUID-indexed
database.  However, the application's ACLs must be accessible to the DCE ACL
library routines, and these routines expect a database, indexed by ACL UUIDs,
containing only ACLs.  
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 10>This allows us, for example, to call a DCE routine such
as <Function>dce_acl_is_client_authorized(&thinsp;)</Function> (see the

course be only one <Literal>server_mgmt</Literal> object).  Still, <Literal>sample_object</Literal> and

means something quite different from having access to the other. <Literal>sample_object</Literal>

access to the server's remote management routines, which involves such things as

</Para>
<Para>A practical sense of what this means can be had from looking at the two
managers' ACL printstrings, near the top of the <Filename>sample_server.c</Filename> file.
These strings, which contain text representations of the full range of permissions
supported by the respective managers, show that there are many permissions that are
unique to a single manager.  For example, there is a <Literal>m_inq_if</Literal> permission

 *
 * sample_resolve_by_name -- take the name of an object, and return the
 *                           UUID of the object's ACL.
 * 
 * The address of this function is passed (via the call to
 * server_acl_mgr_setup()) to the dce_acl_register_object_type() call.  So
 * it gets implicitly called anytime someone tries to retrieve the ACL of
 * an object managed by the ACL manager we've set up. 
 * 
 * 
 * Basically, the most a server needs is one resolve-by-name routine and
 * one resolve-by-UUID routine; the former gets you the desired object's
 * UUID; and the latter then will get you the object data itself (the way
 * this works can be seen in the body of this routine below).  In most
 * cases, these routines will share the same name and UUID databases; if
 * they don't, the resolver_arg can be used to point to the correct other
 * database.  Typically, the only difference between the managers is that
 * they use different print strings.
 * 
 * 
 * For the official statement of the signature of a dce_acl_resolve_func_t,
 * see the dce_acl_resolve_by_uuid() reference page; that routine has the same
 * type.
