<title>File-Access Overview</title>
<para>File-Access is a program that allows you to access Distributed File
Service (DFS)  files resident on a workstation that is part of a Distributed
Computing Environment (DCE) cell, from a PC running NetWare&reg; and allows
you to manipulate DFS files using MS-DOS file manipulation commands and programming
interfaces. The following sections describe features of the  File-Access functions
and the programs in File-Access:  </para>

<sect1>
<title>What is File-Access?  </title>
<para>File-Access software allows you to access directories or files on a
DCE/DFS  workstation from PC-based NetWare via a TCP/IP network. With File-Access,
 you can access DFS directories and files in a workstation by using MS-DOS
 commands and operations on a PC. </para>
<para>With File-Access, NetWare users in multiple NetWare environments can
access  the same DCE/DFS directories and files. As a result, you can create
a file sharing system by using your PC's NetWare environment and the workstation's
 DCE environment.  </para>
<para>Because File-Access temporarily copies the DFS/DCE directory structure
onto a volume  in the NetWare server, you can actually access DFS files by
 accessing files on the NetWare server through a NetWare client. <!-- <xref
linkend="fig1f1.xref"> -->Figure 1-1 illustrates how to use File-Access to
access DCE through NetWare.    </para>

</figure>
</sect1>
<sect1>
<title>Features of File-Access </title>
<para>File-Access has a number of features that enable it to access DFS/DCE
directories and files through NetWare. The following subsections describe
them.  </para>
<sect2>
<title>Accessing DFS Directories and Files Via NetWare  </title>
<para>Using File-Access, you can log into DCE and access DFS directories and
files  from the NetWare client. A user on the NetWare client does not need
to  use DCE commands or a DCE username.  </para>
<para>Like NetWare, File-Access manages file systems found in volumes. You
can use NetWare commands to manage the directories and files in these  file
systems.  </para>
<para>The access control list (ACL), which contains the DFS access restrictions,
is  converted to rights for the NetWare trustee. Because the rights for DCE
are the  same as those for NetWare, the user does not need to reset them. 
</para>
<note><title> Note: </title><para>The functions that File-Access trustee rights
privide are slightly different from those that NetWare trustee rights provide. 
</para>
</note>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Accessing Any Part of the DFS File System  </title>
<para>You can access any DFS directory from NetWare with File-Access. For
example,  the DCE environment may be used to create a DFS file system for
each department in a company. File-Access allows you to access through NetWare
only the  departments you need and only the directories you need in those
departments.  </para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Using Existing Applications to Edit DFS Files  </title>
<para>You can work on DFS directories and files in the same way you handle
files and  directories on the NetWare file system. Accordingly, using your
word processing and spreadsheet software, you can edit DFS files and use programs
like  Windows File Manager to change directory and file settings.  </para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1>
<title>File-Access Program Structure  </title>
<para>File-Access consists of three programs, Client utility, Gateway and
Agent. These  programs run on the NetWare client, NetWare server, and DFS
client. The software required for File-Access is as follows:  </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Netware server: Netware 3.12, MS-DOS 5.0 (or newer version)
 </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Netware client (*1): MS-DOS 5.0 (or newer version), NetWare
3.12 DOS Requester  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>DFS client (*2): RIOS 3.2.5 (or newer version) (compatible
version/revision for DCE), OSF/DCE V1.1 (or newer version)  </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note><title>Note: </title><para>If you use Local File System (LFS), you need
to install  DCE/DFS on the DFS server.  </para>
</note>

</figure> 
-->
<sect2>
<title>Client Utility </title>
<para>The Client utility resides in the NetWare server with Gateway. You 
can open the Client utility program after logging into the NetWare server
from  the NetWare client.  </para>
<para>The Client utility has the following functions: </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Displaying information on directories and files in the Gateway
volume  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Displaying and setting up trustee rights  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Logging into DCE from NetWare/logging out of DCE from NetWare 
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Setting or changing a DCE password  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Adding and deleting rights to and from files and directories
 </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>A user who is accessing DCE from NetWare has a NetWare user account,
DCE  username, and DCE password. This type of user is called a <emphasis>
Gateway user.</emphasis> In this  guide, the term <emphasis>user</emphasis>
indicates a Gateway user unless otherwise noted.  </para>
<sect3>
<title>Command-line Utility  </title>
<para>The Command-line utility is a group of commands used to run File-Access
in  MS-DOS on a NetWare client. The Command-line utility includes commands
 for DCE login, logout, display of information on directories and files in
the  Gateway volume, and display and setup of trustee rights.  </para>
<para>Before you use the Command-line utility, you need to log into NetWare.
If you  create a login script or batch file, you can log into NetWare and
DCE simultaneously. See Chapter 3 for information on simultaneous login.  
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Gateway  </title>
<para>The Gateway program resides in each NetWare server. This program converts
 DCE access requests from NetWare to DFS information. After conversion, the
 information is sent to the Agent program in the DFS client. Each Gateway
program sends access requests to only one Agent program; it is not possible
to  access multiple Agent programs through a single Gateway program.  </para>
<para>Gateway includes an Administration utility, which creates the File-Access
envi- ronment on the NetWare server. With File-Access, the administrator uses
the  Administration utility to allocate DFS directories to a Gateway volume
on the  NetWare server. Once all the DFS directories are allocated to the
Gateway volume, it is possible to edit data just as you would in directories
and files in other  NetWare volumes.  </para>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Agent </title>
<para>The Agent program resides in and runs on the DFS client. This program
 receives DCE access requests from Gateway, accesses directories and files
on the  DFS server, and returns the transaction results to Gateway. A single
Agent program can process access requests from multiple Gateway programs.
 </para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1>
<title>Basics of File-Access </title>
<para>This section explains the basics of File-Access.  </para>
<para>These are the main parts of File-Access: </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Volume allocation  </para>

<listitem><para>Network drive mapping  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Accessing DCE files and directories from NetWare  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>File-Access user requirements  </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<sect2>
<title>Volume Allocation  </title>
<para>In order to access DFS directories and files from NetWare in File-Access,
you  need to create a File-Access-specific Gateway volume. This function is
used to  create the Gateway volume on NetWare. Specified DFS directories (mount
 points) are allocated to the Gateway volume. The administrator
(or a user with  rights to use the Administration utility) sets up the volume
allocations by using  the Gateway Administration utility. Ask the system administrator
to perform  this setup if necessary.  </para>
<para>Figure 1-2 <!-- <xref linkend="fig1f3.xref"> -->illustrates the basics
of volume allocation.</para>

</figure>
<!----></sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Network Drive Mapping  </title>
<para>The DFS directories allocated to the Gateway volume can also be mapped
to the  NetWare network drive by using the NetWare mapping function. Figure
1-3 <!-- <xref linkend="fig1f4.xref"> -->provides an example of network drive
mapping. </para>

</figure>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>Accessing DCE from NetWare </title>
<para>Users must log into DCE through the NetWare server before they can access
 directories and files in the Gateway volume.  </para>
<para>Figure 1-4 <!-- <xref linkend="fig1f5.xref"> -->shows the process of
accessing DFS files after the user logs into DCE  from the NetWare client.

</figure>
<para>Note the following user options:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>When you access a file while running an application, Gateway
sends a  request through Agent in the DFS client to the DFS server to perform
the  required file process.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>After a file is opened, it is copied to the Gateway volume
on the corresponding NetWare server.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>You can edit data and perform other operations on files copied
to the Gateway volume.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>You can exit File-Access from an application.  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>You can overwrite DCE/DFS files with files in the Gateway
volume.  </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect2>
<sect2>
<title>File-Access User Requirements  </title>
<para>You must have a username and password in both NetWare and DCE in order
to  to use access File-Access to access DCE from NetWare. File-Access registers
the  association between NetWare usernames and the DCE usernames and passwords
within its own database through the Gateway Administration utility. The  Gateway
Administration utility cannot set usernames and passwords to  NetWare. Thus,
it is not necessary to enter your DCE username or password  when you log into
DCE from NetWare. This type of user is called a Gateway user.  In this guide,
the term user indicates a Gateway user unless otherwise noted.  </para>
<para>For details on the mapping of NetWare usernames and DCE usernames, see
the  DCE/File-Access Administration Guide and Reference.  </para>
</sect2>
</sect1>
<sect1>
<title>Directory/Filename Conversion Between DFS and Gateway Volumes  </title>
<para>The names for NetWare directories and files conform to MS-DOS naming
rules.  The names for DFS directories and files follow UNIX naming rules.
The names  of directories and files for NetWare and DFS differ from each other
in terms of  the number and type of characters allowed. Sometimes the name
of a DFS directory or file is invalid in NetWare. </para>
<para>File-Access converts names of DFS directories and files to the NetWare
format.  The following subsections explain the relationship between DFS and
Gateway  volume names.  </para>
<sect2 id="sect151.xref">
<title>Changing Lowercase Letters in a Name to Uppercase Letters  </title>
<para>File-Access can be used to capitalize all the lowercase letters of a
DFS directory  or filename, but to do so, all of the following conditions
must be met: </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The name consists of lowercase characters  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The name does not contain a dot (&thinsp;.&thinsp;) and has
eight or fewer characters  (1 character = 1 byte)  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The name has a single dot in it, preceded by at least one
but no more than  eight characters, and followed by no more than three characters
(1 character = 1 byte)  </para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>The name does not include the following characters:</para>
<para><Literal>. , + [ ] * ? : \ / ; = &lt; >  | (space) </Literal></para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note><title>Note: </title><para>A dot can be used in a name as an extension.

<title>Tildes and Key Numbers as Names  </title>
<para>The Gateway volume format is applied to directory names and filenames
not  described in the previous subsection, ``Changing Lowercase Letters in
a Name to Uppercase Letters''. <!-- <xref linkend="sect151.xref"> -->Some
letters are changed to uppercase letters, and tildes or key numbers are assigned
to the rest. Keys numbers are uniquely assigned  numbers that are used to
avoid the duplication of the same name in the same directory. </para>
<para>For directory and filenames, the sixth character is converted to a tilde,
and the  seventh and eighth characters to key numbers. (Some names have a
3-character  extension.) If the name has fewer than five characters, tildes
are added to  increase the length to five characters.  </para>

<para><literal>con  prn  aux  nul  clocks  com1  com2  com3  com4  lpt1  lpt2
 lpt3</literal></para>
<para>If these character strings are used as names for DFS directories and
files (including cases where the name is on the left side of the extension),
File-Access  converts them to tildes and keys so that they will not be the
same as MS-DOS  device names. (If the characters are uppercase letters, they
are also converted in  the same manner.)  </para>
<para>Device names not included in this list are not converted by File-Access.
For this  reason, directories and files with the same names as MS-DOS devices
can be  created in the Gateway volume. You should not access these directories
and  files from the NetWare client. </para>

<title>Examples of File-Access Use </title>
<para> With File-Access, NetWare users in multiple NetWare environments can
access  the same DCE/DFS directories and files. You can create a file sharing
system  that uses both the PC NetWare environment and the workstation DCE
environment. </para>
<para>For example, assume that the headquarters and sales offices A and B
are in the  DCE environment. Each sales office has its own NetWare environment.
The  DCE environment is made up of the headquarters' DFS server, as well as
DFS  clients at sales offices A and B. The group and user directories in the
DFS file  system at headquarters are allocated to two SALES volumes, which
run on the  NetWare servers of sales offices A and B through File-Access.
Thus the two sales  offices can share the monthly sales report DFS text files
that are managed by  headquarters. Figure 1-5 <!-- <xref linkend="fig1f6.xref">
