<title>Important Points About the Commands  </title>
<para>This subsection reviews important points and limitations regarding the
use of  File-Access commands.  </para>
<sect3>
<title>Commands Specific to Gateway Volumes  </title>
<para>Use File-Access commands only for directories and files in Gateway volumes.
 Use NetWare commands to retrieve and set NetWare directory and file information. You cannot use File-Access commands to access directories and files
in  local volumes.  </para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Wildcard Characters  </title>
<para>You can use asterisks (&thinsp;*&thinsp;) and question marks 
(&thinsp;?&thinsp;) as wildcard characters
in  File-Access commands. Use wildcard characters as they
are  used in NetWare. See the NetWare manual for details.  </para>
</sect3>
<sect3>
<title>Pathnames That Can Be Used  </title>
<para>The specified pathname can contain either the mapped MS-DOS drive name
or  the NetWare volume name. If a NetWare volume name is specified, MS-DOS
 drive mapping is not necessary. However, the NetWare volume must be  mounted
in the NetWare server that you are logging into or attaching to.</para>

<para>If <literal>ONLY</literal> is selected, only the rights specified in
the <emphasis>rights_list</emphasis> argument are  permitted. Rights that are not specified are
not allowed, even if they were set prior to executing the <command>DGRANT</command> command. If <literal>ALL BUT</literal> is selected, all  rights
not specified in the <emphasis>rights_list</emphasis> argument are permitted. These arguments are
always specified before the rights list.  </para>
<para>If you omit this argument, the rights status settings preceding the
command are  set along with either or both of the rights specified on the
list of  rights set in the rights list.  </para>
<para>If <literal>ALL</literal> or <literal>NO RIGHT</literal> is set in the
<emphasis>rights_list</emphasis> argument, the arguments  <literal>ONLY</literal> or <literal>
ALL BUT</literal> cannot be specified.  </para>
</listitem><listitem><para><replaceable>rights_list</replaceable></para>
<para>This argument specifies the rights that are to be permitted. See ``Functions''
 for details regarding the rights that can be specified. It is possible to
specify  multiple rights from the rights list.  </para>
</listitem><listitem><para><replaceable>pathname </replaceable> </para>
<para>This argument specifies a pathname for a directory or file in the Gateway
 volume. You can use both the absolute pathname and the relative  pathname. You can also use wildcard characters (? and *). If you omit the  pathname argument, the system  defaults to the current
drive.  </para>
<para>You can include an MS-DOS drive name and NetWare volume name in the
 pathname. When you set a NetWare volume name in the path, MS-DOS  drive mapping
is not necessary. However, the NetWare volume must be  installed in the NetWare
Server you are logging into or attaching to.  </para>
</listitem><listitem><para><Literal>USER | GROUP</Literal></para>
<para>This argument specifies whether to assign rights to the
user  or to the group. Specify a username after <literal>USER</literal>, and
a group name after  <literal>GROUP</literal>. If you omit this argument, the <replaceable>
name</replaceable> you specified is recognized as a username. If there is
no such username, it is recognized as a group  name.  </para>
<para>However, when the username or group name is <literal>USER</literal>
or <literal>GROUP</literal>, do not  omit this argument. For example, if you
specify the name <literal>USER USER</literal>, the  second <literal>USER</literal>
is recognized as the username. If you specify the name  <literal>USER GROUP
</literal>, <literal>GROUP</literal> is taken as the username. The same rules
apply to  the argument for <literal>GROUP</literal>.  </para>
</listitem><listitem><para><replaceable>name  </replaceable></para>
<para>This argument allows you to specify  a username or a group name to

<para> The <command>DGRANT</command> command assigns trustee rights to trustees
on directories and  files in the Gateway volume. Trustee rights set restrictions
on user and group  access to a directory or file. User and group access rights
are assigned by setting  these trustee rights in the rights list. Keywords
that you can specify in the rights  list are <literal>ALL</literal>, <literal>NO RIGHT</literal> (or <literal>N</literal>) and trustee
rights.  ALL means all trustee rights  are specified, <literal>NO RIGHT</literal> (or <literal>N</literal>) means
all trustee rights are deleted. Table 4-2 indicates the
<!-- <xref linkend="tab4f2.xref"> -->
trustee rights that can be assigned. Note that the Qualified right  assigns
to the trustee the right to modify, but not the right to erase.  </para>
