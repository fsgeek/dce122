<Para>This chapter introduces basic concepts of the DCE Distributed File Service
(DFS).  It provides introductory information about the components of DFS, the
administrative advantages they offer, and their interaction with other DCE
components.  It also provides a brief overview of some common DFS administrative
tasks, explains the DFS command structure, and describes how you can get help
for DFS commands.  You should read and understand this chapter before performing
any of the tasks detailed in Part 1 of this guide and reference.

<Para>DCE DFS is a distributed
client/server application that presents DCE with a global view of a set of
files and directories (a file system), independent of machine boundaries.  This
global view is called the <Replaceable>DFS filespace</Replaceable>.
</Para>
<Para>DFS is considered distributed because files can be physically stored on many
different machines, but they are available to users on every machine.  DFS 
allows users to share files stored on computers in a network as easily as 
files stored on a local machine.  Despite this distribution of files, it 
still appears to users that there is a single filespace.

<Para>DFS server machines run processes that provide services such as making
data available and monitoring and controlling other processes.  They are
categorized by the processes they run (that is, the roles they assume).  For example, a
server machine that runs the processes necessary for storing and exporting data
assumes the role of a File Server machine.  The processes of a File Server
machine include the Fileset Server, which provides an interface to the
DFS commands and components used to manipulate filesets, and the File
Exporter, which runs in a modified kernel to make DFS files available to the
global namespace.
</Para>
<Para>Other server machine roles include a System Control machine that updates
other server machines with identical versions of system configuration files;
Binary Distribution machines that distribute system binaries to other
machines with the same CPU/operating system type; Fileset Database
machines that house the master and replica versions of the Fileset
Location Database (FLDB) where information about the location of
system and user files is maintained; and Backup Database machines that
house the master and replica versions of the Backup Database where
information used to back up and restore system and user files resides.
(See Chapter 2 for more information about the roles of DFS server machines.)

<Para>DFS client machines provide computational power, access to DFS files,
and other general-purpose tools.  In some configurations, a server machine can
also act as a client machine.
</Para>
<Para>Client machines use a modified kernel that maintains contact with the File
Exporter and server processes running on server machines.  This collection of
kernel modifications on a client machine is known as the <Symbol Role="Variable">Cache Manager</Symbol>.
The main duty of the Cache Manager is to translate file requests made by
application programs on a client machine into Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to
File Exporter processes on File Server machines.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 8>When the Cache Manager receives requested data from a File Exporter, it
caches the data (stores it on disk or in memory) before passing it to the
application program that requested it.  In addition, DFS ensures that the 
Cache Manager always has access to the most current copy of the data.  If the 
central copy of the file containing the data changes, the Cache Manager 
retrieves the newer version of the file the next time data from the file
is requested (or in the case of read-only data, within a configurable 
period of time).  The user does not have to direct the Cache Manager to keep 
a current copy; the Cache Manager's actions are automatic and completely 
transparent to the user.

<Para>To synchronize distributed access to data, the File Exporter on each File
Server machine distributes <Replaceable>tokens</Replaceable> to clients that access data from the
machine.  The File Exporter uses tokens to manage access to data and metadata.
Tokens guarantee that each client is working with the most recent version of
the data and that multiple clients are not accessing the same data in a 
conflicting manner.  Tokens are fully transparent to both users and 
administrators.
</Para>
<Para>When a client such as the Cache Manager needs to access or change a file
or directory that is managed by the File Exporter, it first requests the
appropriate tokens for the data from the File Exporter.  The File Exporter's
response to the client's request depends on the data the client wants to
manipulate, the operation the client wants to perform on the data, and whether
any other clients currently have tokens for the data.
</Para>
<Para>If no other clients have tokens for the data, the File Exporter can issue the
client the appropriate tokens.  If outstanding tokens for the data exist, the
File Exporter can grant the request (if no conflicts arise between the request
and the outstanding tokens), revoke the existing tokens to grant the request,
or consider the request pending until it can grant it.  In some cases, the File
Exporter simply refuses to grant the request.  If the File Exporter gives the
client the necessary tokens, the client in turn can access the data from the
File Exporter in the fashion requested.

<Para>A user can have access to several cells. However, the user's Universal Unique
Identifier (UUID) appears in the registry for only a single cell.  This cell is

</Para>
<Para>When logging into a machine, the user authenticates to the cell to which
that machine belongs.  If the machine belongs to the user's home cell, the
user's UUID appears in the registry in that cell.  If the machine is in a
foreign cell, the user's UUID does not appear in the cell's registry; mutual
trust must exist between the foreign cell and the user's home cell for the
user to successfully authenticate to the foreign cell.  The system administrator
who configures your cell determines whether your cell participates in the
global naming service.  If your cell participates in the global naming service,
you can permit users from foreign cells that also participate in the global
naming service and that have established mutual trust with your cell to access
your data, and vice versa.

<Para>DFS further extends the concept of a DCE cell by providing
DFS administrative domains.  An administrative domain is
a collection of associated server machines from the same cell configured
for administration as a single unit.  A cell can include a large number
of machines; administrative domains provide a means of simplifying the
administration of many DFS machines in a single DCE cell by
organizing a subset of the cell's machines into smaller administrative
units.  In addition to simplifying the management of DFS in a DCE
cell, administrative domains bring fine levels of granularity and
flexibility to DFS administration in general.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 8>A cell can have one or more administrative domains. An
administrative domain, like a cell, can include server machines that
perform many of the machine roles mentioned previously.  A machine can be
a member of multiple domains, but all of the machines in a domain must
be members of the same cell.  For example, all of the domains in a cell
can use the same Binary Distribution machine for a machine type, but
that machine must be in the same cell as all of the machines in all of
the domains.  Administrative domains are transparent from the end-user's
perspective.

having the permissions necessary to issue requests to the associated server
process.  Individual users can be placed on administrative lists to grant them
the administrative privileges associated with the lists.  Groups of users
can also be placed on administrative lists to grant the privileges associated
with that list to all of the members of the group simultaneously; the members
of a group have all the privileges associated with any administrative lists in
which the group is included.  In addition, server machines can, and in some
cases must, be placed on administrative lists.

<Para>For instance, you can create a group called <Literal>domain1.admin</Literal> and include it
in the administrative lists necessary to allow its members to administer data
on the File Server machines in a single domain.  You can then assign users to
the <Literal>domain1.admin</Literal> group to grant them administrative privileges on the
File Server machines in the domain; you do not need to include each individual

<Para><?sml-need 10>Similarly, you can create additional groups for other administrative tasks,

working with the most recent copy of a file and to track who is currently
working with the file.  Tokens identify operations the client can perform on
the data.  They also act as a promise from the File Exporter that it will
notify the client if the centrally stored copy of the data changes; following
such notification, the client can then retrieve the most recent copy of the
data the next time it is requested by a user.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 10>DFS also improves the reliability of data access by allowing you to replicate
commonly used DCE LFS filesets on multiple File Server machines.  When you

fileset generally does not interrupt work involving that fileset because 
the fileset is still available from other machines.

<Title>Better Recovery from Failure</Title>
<Para>As detailed previously, recovering from an abnormal system shutdown is easier
because DCE LFS automatically maintains a log of the current state of the
metadata associated with aggregates and filesets.  Recovery from more severe
system failures that can include the loss of data is also easier because the
DFS Backup System allows system and user data to be backed up to tape.
Information about backups, which is maintained in the Backup Database, can 
be used to easily and reliably restore system and user data to its state at 
the last backup or at a specific date.
</Para>
<Para>Recovery from system failure in most UNIX file systems involves using the
<Command>fsck</Command> command to ensure that no file systems are corrupted and, if they
are, to correct the problems so that they do not spread through the entire
file system.  In DFS, such measures are not required at every restart.  When
they are needed, they involve the use of the DFS Salvager to locate and
correct serious data corruption from which DCE LFS cannot recover without
assistance.  In some cases, problems may occur in the basic structure of the
file system or the log may be damaged.  The Salvager lets you check the file
system and correct problems to prevent corruption of the entire DCE LFS
aggregate on which the file system is stored; it detects and repairs
inconsistencies in the file system's metadata to return the file system to a
consistent state.
</Para>
<Para RevisionFlag="Changed"><?sml-need 10>After a File Server machine is restarted, the File Exporter attempts to restore
consistent access to data on the machine.  For a brief time after the restart,
it prevents all clients from establishing new tokens for data on the server

tokens from the clients that held them before it was restarted; these clients
have the opportunity to recover their tokens before any client can request
conflicting tokens.  Providing clients with the opportunity to regain their 
tokens after a File Server machine restart is one form of a practice

<Para>Load balancing of data is more efficient in DFS than in standard
nondistributed file systems.  One reason is the use of replication, which
allows DCE LFS filesets to be reproduced on multiple machines.  
Requests for
files from frequently used DCE LFS filesets are then spread across different
machines, preventing any one machine from becoming overburdened with data
requests.  Multihomed server capability makes it possible for each machine
to have multiple connections to the network, allowing direct connections
to the subnetworks that provide the most requests.  These connections help
reduce cross-router traffic within the network.
<?og-ChangeEnd enh,13566,R1.2.2,Add multihomed server"></Para>
<Para>Fileset characteristics in DCE LFS also improve load balancing.  DCE LFS
filesets are typically smaller than standard UNIX and other non-LFS filesets;
DCE LFS aggregates can accommodate multiple DCE LFS filesets for flexible disk
usage; and DCE LFS filesets can be moved between aggregates on different File
Server machines.  The ability to store multiple filesets on a single aggregate
is integral to being able to move filesets in DFS.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 10>DFS automatically tracks every fileset's location, even when the fileset is
moved between aggregates or machines.  The location of any fileset is
automatically maintained in DFS by the Fileset Location Database (FLDB).  This
database tracks the machine and aggregate that houses each exported fileset 
(DCE LFS or non-LFS).  Therefore, the user never needs to know the machine 
or aggregate that actually houses the fileset.
</Para>
<Para>The FLDB relieves the system administrator of the burden of manually tracking
each fileset's location, thus freeing the administrator to concentrate on more
important administrative duties.  Also, the master version of the database is
typically replicated and synchronized (using Ubik) on multiple server machines,
making access to the FLDB more reliable.

</Para>
<Para>However, commands that access file and directory objects in the DFS filespace

and it must point to the location of the DFS junction in the CDS namespace of
the local cell.  The link must be created on each DFS client machine; it is
usually created when a machine is configured as a DFS client.
</Para>
<Para>For example, suppose a pathname that begins with the <Literal>/:</Literal> prefix is used
with the <Command>dcecp acl</Command> command.  For the command to succeed, the symbolic link
<Literal>/:</Literal> must exist in the root directory of the machine on which the command
is issued, and the link must point to the CDS entry
<Filename>/.../</Filename><Symbol Role="Variable">cellname</Symbol><Filename>/fs</Filename> (or whatever name is used for the DFS junction in
the local cell); otherwise, the command fails because it cannot interpret the
<Literal>/:</Literal> prefix.
</Para>
<Para>Note that the <Filename>/.:</Filename> and <Literal>/:</Literal> prefixes are abbreviations intended
primarily for interactive use, not for use in persistent storage such as shell
scripts.  Use global names (of the form <Filename>/.../</Filename><Symbol Role="Variable">cellname</Symbol>) for pathnames
in persistent storage.  Note especially that the <Filename>/.:</Filename> and <Literal>/:</Literal> prefixes
cannot be used in strings in which a <Literal>:</Literal> (colon) has a reserved meaning.
For example, you cannot use the prefixes in the definition of a <SystemItem Class="EnvironVar">PATH</SystemItem>
environment variable in operating systems such as the UNIX system; in this case, the
<Literal>:</Literal> is used to separate different pathnames, so including a prefix in the
definition of a <SystemItem Class="EnvironVar">PATH</SystemItem> environment variable violates the reserved nature
of the <Literal>:</Literal> for that variable.

<Literal>/.../abc.com</Literal> or <Literal>/.../abc.com/fs</Literal>.  Also,

categories, or command suites:
</Para>
<VariableList>
<VarListEntry>
<Term><Command>bak</Command></Term>
<ListItem>
<Para>The <Command>bak</Command> command suite is used to copy files from the file system to a
backup tape and to restore them from tape to the file system, as necessary.
System administrators issue <Command>bak</Command> commands to operate the DFS Backup
System; users do not use them.

<Para>DFS also includes a number of miscellaneous, nonsuite commands; for example,
the <Command>scout</Command> command is used by system
administrators to monitor File Exporter usage statistics.  DFS also includes
an additional command suite, <Command>dfsgw</Command>, that is used with the DFS/NFS
Secure Gateway to administer DCE credentials for NFS users.
</Para>
<Para>System administrators can issue all DFS commands; users can issue only those
DFS commands that require no administrative privileges (for example, the <Command>fts
lsquota</Command> command).  Section 1.5 provides information about the structure of
DFS commands and describes how to receive online help for them.

<Symbol Role="Variable">date</Symbol> are their arguments; in the second example, <Option>path</Option> is the only
option.
</Para>
<Para>An option and its arguments tell the server process or program which entities

</Para>
<Para>If you must provide an option, you can abbreviate it to the shortest possible
form that distinguishes it from other options of the command.  For example,
the <Option>server</Option> option found in many DFS commands can typically be omitted

<Para><?sml-need 15>You can also abbreviate a command name to the shortest form that still
distinguishes it from the other command names in its suite.  For example, you
can shorten the <Command>fts help</Command> command to <Command>fts h</Command> because no other command
names in the <Command>fts</Command> command suite begin with the letter <Symbol Role="Variable">h</Symbol>. However, there
are several <Command>fts</Command> commands that begin with the letter
<Symbol Role="Variable">l</Symbol>, such as <Command>fts lsquota</Command>,
<Command>fts lsmount</Command>, and others.  To avoid ambiguity, you can
abbreviate these commands to <Command>fts lsq</Command> and <Command>fts
lsm</Command>; other <Command>fts</Command> command names that begin with
<Symbol Role="Variable">l</Symbol> can be abbreviated in a similar fashion.
Note that because miscellaneous DFS commands are not included in a suite,
their names cannot be abbreviated.
</Para>
<Para>The following example illustrates three acceptable ways to enter the same
<Command>fts lsquota</Command> command:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Complete command:
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput>$ <Literal>fts lsquota -path jlw/doc jlw/public</Literal>
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Abbreviated command name and abbreviated option:
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput>$ <Literal>fts lsq -p jlw/doc jlw/public</Literal>
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Abbreviated command name and omitted option:
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput>$ <Literal>fts lsq jlw/doc jlw/public</Literal>
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Note>
<Para>The <Command>dfs_login</Command> and <Command>dfs_logout</Command>
commands provided with the DFS/NFS Secure Gateway do not provide the shortcuts
and help available with other DFS commands.  See the reference pages for these
commands for information about using them.

<Para>You can access help for DFS commands in several ways. The following list
summarizes the syntax for the different help options:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>To view the introductory page for a command suite, enter <Command>man</Command> followed by
the command suite.
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput>$ <Command>man </Command><Symbol Role="Variable">command_suite</Symbol>
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>To view the reference page for an individual command in a suite, enter
<Command>man</Command> followed by the command suite and the command name.  Use an _
(underscore) to connect the command suite to the command name.  Do <Symbol Role="Variable">not</Symbol> use
the underscore when issuing the command in DFS.
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput>$ <Command>man </Command><Symbol Role="Variable">command_suite</Symbol><Literal>_</Literal><Symbol Role="Variable">command_name</Symbol>
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>To view a list of all commands in a command suite, enter the command suite
followed by <Command>help</Command>.
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput>$ <Symbol Role="Variable">command_suite </Symbol><Command>help</Command>
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>To view the syntax of a specific command, enter the command suite, <Command>help</Command>,
and the command name, in that order.
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput>$ <Symbol Role="Variable">command_suite </Symbol><Command>help </Command><Symbol Role="Variable">command_name</Symbol>
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>In addition, all DFS commands include a <Option>help</Option> option you can use to
display the syntax of the command.
</Para>
<Para>The DFS <Literal>apropos</Literal> command is similar to the UNIX <Literal>apropos</Literal> command. It
displays the first line of the online help entry for any command in an
indicated suite that has a specified string in its name or short description.
This information is useful if you cannot remember the exact name of a command.
 If the string is more than a single word, surround it with "&thinsp;" (double
quotes) or other delimiters.  Enter all strings in lowercase letters.
</Para>
<Para>For example, the following command produces a list of all <Command>bos</Command> commands
with the word <Command>create</Command> in their names or descriptions:
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput>$ <Command>bos apropos -topic create</Command>
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
<Para>All methods of obtaining help are also available with miscellaneous, nonsuite
DFS commands.
