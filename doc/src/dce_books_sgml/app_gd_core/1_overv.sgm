<Title>Overview of Security</Title>
<Para>This chapter provides a brief overview of the two security services
available in DCE:

<Title>Purpose and Organization of the Security Chapters</Title>
<Para>This part of the guide explains the major
features of DCE security so that you can decide what, if anything,
you need to do to ensure that your DCE application is sufficiently
secure.  A lot of security is built into DCE, so in many cases you will
need to do nothing, or very little, to secure your DCE application.  
Furthermore, you do not need to understand all of the 
details of the DCE security services in order to use them effectively.
</Para>
<Para>Following the overview of the DCE Security Service
in this chapter are two chapters
that contain conceptual discussions of authentication and authorization.
The remaining chapters in this part of the guide discuss the DCE

</IndexTerm>
<Para>Perhaps the most important security facility is the 
authenticated remote procedure call (RPC) facility.  Authenticated 
RPC enables distributed applications
to participate in authenticated network communications.  Applications
using the authenticated RPC routines may select the authentication
protocol and the authorization protocol to be used, and
set various protocol-independent protection levels for communicating
with remote entities (users, servers, and computers).
</Para>
<Para>The use of authenticated RPC is explained in Chapters 13 and 14.
Chapter 14 contains information about a number of RPC
routines that relate directly to security issues, such as
<Function>rpc_binding_set_auth_info()</Function>. 
</Para>
<Para>These security chapters, however, contains conceptual information that is
useful for understanding the authentication and authorization protocols
that authenticated RPC routines use; for this information, we recommend
that you read Chapters 24 and 25, as well as this one.

<Para>The GSS provides an alternate way of
providing DCE security to distributed applications that handle network
communications by themselves.  With GSSAPI, you can include established
applications in DCE and ensure the security and integrity of the
applications and their data.
In peer-to-peer communications, the
application that establishes the secure connection is the <FirstTerm>context
initiator</FirstTerm> or simply <FirstTerm>initiator</FirstTerm>.  The context initiator is like a
DCE RPC client.  The application that accepts the secure connection is
the <FirstTerm>context acceptor</FirstTerm> or simply <FirstTerm>acceptor</FirstTerm>.  The context
acceptor is like a DCE RPC server.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 5>The GSS available with DCE includes two
sets of routines:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Standard GSSAPI routines, which are defined in the 
Internet RFC 1509 ``Generic Security Service API: C-bindings.''
These routines have the prefix <Literal>gss_</Literal>.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>OSF DCE extensions to the GSSAPI routines.  These are additional routines
that enable an application to use DCE security services.  These routines
have the prefix <Literal>gssdce_</Literal>.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>The chapters that follow provide information about how the GSSAPI
routines use the authentication and authorization protocols.  Chapter 26
provides information about GSS credentials, which are used to establish
an application's identity in DCE.

<Title>UNIX System Security and DCE Security</Title>
<IndexTerm Id="DCEADG.SECOV.indx.12">

<Secondary>UNIX versus DCE</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>UNIX system security mostly presumes that a computer's backplane can
be trusted because computing operations are assumed to be local, and
because the computer itself can be physically secured.  In a distributed
environment, the logical equivalent of the single system's backplane
is the network itself.  Network computing means distributed, rather
than localized, computing operations and, in the case of an open network
(which DCE assumes), little of the network is physically secure.  Thus,
<IndexTerm Id="DCEADG.SECOV.indx.13">
<Primary>security</Primary>
<Secondary>risks</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>the nature of distributed systems poses special security risks, in
addition to those posed by nondistributed systems.  Unlike UNIX system
security, DCE security is designed specifically to address those risks.
</Para>
<Para>These considerations notwithstanding, network security is ultimately
dependent on the security features that are local to the individual
computers in the network and, what is more important, the manner in
which those features are used and administered.  Since any compromise
to the local security of a computer in the distributed environment
may introduce opportunities for compromising network security, DCE
security does not diminish the importance of local security.  In fact,
the relative importance of local system security is greater in the
distributed environment because the consequences of a local security
breach may not be local.  Finally, while DCE security does nothing
to enhance local security, neither does it introduce any new avenues
for compromising local security.
</Para>
<Para>In the discussions in this guide, we assume you are familiar with
the authentication and authorization features that UNIX systems 
provide: <Filename>/etc/passwd</Filename> and<Filename> /etc/group</Filename> file processing, routines that
return or change file attributes, routines that return or change real
or effective user IDs (UIDs) and group IDs (GIDs), 
and data encryption and decryption.

<Para>There are two questions that DCE security can answer for a principal
about another principal with which it might want to communicate:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Is this principal really who it says it is?
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Does it have the right to do what it wants to do?
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>Depending on the answers to these questions, a security-sensitive
principal takes different courses of action with respect to a principal
with which it is communicating.
</Para>
<Para>To authenticate a principal means to verify that the principal is
representing its true identity.  To authorize a principal means to
grant permission for the principal to perform an operation.
While distinct, the concepts of authentication and authorization are
also intertwined.  For one thing, a principal's authorization is explicitly
linked to its identity.  For another, there is the possibility that
authorization data concerning an authenticated principal can be falsified,
which raises the additional question, ``Should the authorization
data concerning this principal be believed?''  To this question also,
DCE security can provide an answer to a principal for which this issue
is a concern.

</Sect1>
<Sect1 Id="DCEADG.SECOV.div.7">
<Title>Authentication, Authorization, and Data Protection in Brief</Title>
<Para>When one principal talks to another in a distributed computing environment,
there is a risk that communications between the two will provide a
means for compromising the security of one or the other.  For example,
a client may attack a server, or a server may set a trap for clients.
An attack is most likely to succeed if the malevolent principal can
convince its victim that it is something other than what it really
is (an attacker), and/or that it possesses authorization that it does
not really have.  A counterfeit identity and/or authorization data
grants an attacker access that it presumably would not otherwise have,
and so provides an opportunity for the attacker to do damage. 
</Para>
<Para>One way an attacker might obtain counterfeit credentials is to intercept
network transmissions between a client and a server, and then attempt
to decipher (and perhaps modify) the transmitted data.
If the attacker is able to intercept <Symbol Role="Variable">and decipher</Symbol> a principal's authentication
or authorization information, it can later use this data to masquerade as an 
authentic principal with proper authorization.
</Para>
<Para>DCE security protects against these kinds of attacks. It contains features 
that enable principals to

<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Detect whether data they receive has
been modified in transit
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Be certain that an attacker will be unable to decipher any 
authentication and authorization data it may succeed in intercepting
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>DCE security gives DCE principals confidence that the identity and 
authorization of principals they communicate with are authentic.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 5>Figure 23-1 is an extremely condensed and highly stylized representation of
the essentials of DCE security in terms of the DCE shared-secret
authentication protocol and the DCE authorization protocol.
Unless we note otherwise, assume that discussions in the security
chapters of this guide refer to these two protocols, used in conjunction with
one another.
</Para>
<Para>The following is a description of the events depicted in the illustration:
</Para>
<OrderedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Principal A (which could be an attacker masquerading as Principal A) 
requests authentication of its identity from the authentication service. 
This request is encrypted using several keys, one of which is a key derived 
from the password supplied
by Principal A.  A copy of Principal A's key also exists in the registry 
database, having been stored there when the principal's account was created 
(or when the password was changed).  It is thus available to the authentication 
service.
</Para>
<Para>The authentication service then obtains 
the registry's copy of Principal A's key 
and uses it to decrypt Principal A's authentication request.  If the 
decryption succeeds, the keys are the same; Principal A is therefore
authenticated and the authentication service replies with information
that enables Principal A to ask the privilege service
to authenticate its privilege attributes. 
(Privilege attributes
are data used in making authorization decisions; they consist of the
principal's name and group memberships.) If Principal A fails to get
authenticated privilege attributes (also referred to as <FirstTerm>credentials</FirstTerm>), 
it may simply assert its privilege attributes to Principal B.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Principal A now makes a request
to Principal B to perform some operation that requires the <Literal>c</Literal>
permission to object <Literal>d</Literal>, and presents its certified privilege
attributes.  Principal B may grant or deny <Literal>c</Literal> access to
<Literal>d</Literal> after examining the ACL that
protects object <Literal>d</Literal>.  (An ACL associates the privilege attributes
of principals with permissions to an object.)  If<Literal> c</Literal> is one
of the permissions listed in the ACL granted to Principal A, 
then Principal A is allowed
to perform the operation; if the <Literal>c</Literal> permission is not granted,
A is denied access.
</Para>
<?sml-need 3.5i>
<Figure>
<Title>Shared-Secret Authentication and DCE Authorization in Brief</Title>
<Graphic Entityref="DCEADG.SECOV.ent.1" Scalefit="1" Reprowid="300" Reprodep="300"></Graphic>
</Figure>
<Para>Had the authentication service been unable to decrypt the principal's
authentication request, the principal
would have been unauthenticated and, as a consequence, unable to 
acquire certified privilege attributes from the privilege service.
In that case, Principal A might have simply asserted its privilege
