</IndexTerm>The DCE security server itself comprises three principals that correspond
to the three services that it provides: KDS,
registry service, and privilege service.  The KDS in turn
provides two subservices: the authentication (sub)service and the
ticket-granting (sub)service (TGS).
</Para>
<Note>
<Para>As used in the literature, the term <FirstTerm>authentication service</FirstTerm> is
sometimes ambiguous.  This name may be, in places,
associated with at least three distinct entities: the authentication
(sub)service of the KDS, the KDS itself (comprising its
authentication and ticket-granting subservices), and the entire DCE
Security Service (comprising the KDS, the registry service,
and the privilege service).  
</Para>
</Note>
<Para>These three servers (KDS, registry service, and privilege service)
comprise the main part of the DCE <FirstTerm>network trusted computing base</FirstTerm>.
The KDS, registry service, and privilege service servers are commonly 
all implemented in a single process called the 
security server or security daemon.
</Para>

<Primary>shared-secret authentication protocol</Primary>
</IndexTerm>
<IndexTerm Id="DCEADG.SECAN.indx.21">
<Primary>protocols</Primary>
<Secondary>shared-secret authentication</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>The registry service maintains a database, which 
contains an entry representing every
principal, identifying the principal by its name and a secret key
<FirstTerm>bound</FirstTerm> to it.
It is this binding of the principal identity to a secret key shared with
the registry that is at the root of the DCE shared-secret authentication
protocols, as will be seen in this chapter.
In the case of an interactive principal, the
secret key is derived from the user's
password (at login time).  In order to establish its identity as a principal,
a <FirstTerm>noninteractive principal</FirstTerm>, such as a server or computer, must store
its secret key in a data file or hardware device, or rely on a system
administrator to enter it.  The secret keys of servers are considered to
be stronger than those of users/clients, because they are truly
random (as opposed to being derived from a password, which greatly
restricts their randomness).
</Para>
<Para>DCE shared-secret authentication implements an extended version
of the Kerberos Version 5 system as its authentication protocol.
Namely, the part of the DCE security server that corresponds to Kerberos
is the KDS.  The other parts 
(registry service and privilege service) do not occur in Kerberos.
The Kerberos system was originally developed at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology
as part of Project Athena, and provides a trustworthy, shared-secret
authentication system.  The walkthrough of the authentication protocol
in this chapter describes the protocol in general terms.
</Para>
<Note>
<Para>The KDS is an exceptional principal in that it does not
share its key with any other principal.  KDS surrogates (see Section 24.3) are
also exceptional in that they are not autonomous participants in authenticated
communications, as other kinds of principals are.
</Para>
</Note>
<Para>In the theory of shared-secret authentication 
all principals are initially considered to be
untrusted, except for those in the trusted computing base 
itself (KDS,
registry service, privilege service).  
A security-sensitive application must make use of the trusted
computing base to convince itself of the level of trust it may place in
all other principals.  How that is done is the subject of this chapter.

</IndexTerm>
<Para>The cell is the basic unit of configuration and administration in
DCE. In terms of security, a cell is the set of principals that share
a secret key with an instance of the registry service. Therefore,
each instance of a security server (together with its replicas) defines
a separate cell.
</Para>
<Para>From the perspective of security only, a cell is sometimes also known as a
<FirstTerm>realm</FirstTerm> or <FirstTerm>security domain</FirstTerm>.  (The term
realm is often used in Kerberos documentation, and so may be more familiar
to some readers than is the term <Symbol Role="Variable">cell</Symbol>.)  A security cell is always
configured to coincide with a corresponding CDS cell, and perhaps
Distributed File System (DFS) cell as well.  DCE documentation always refers
to such a collective configuration of services as a cell.

<Para>Protection levels specify how much of the information in network
messages exchanged by principals is encrypted.  As a rule, the higher
the protection level,
the greater the negative impact on performance.  An application can set
a protection level by using either authenticated RPC or GSSAPI.

<!-- per-message protection isn't a "level, or quality, or protection". It refers-->
<!-- to how the protection is applied (i.e you take a message and if you want to-->

Unlike authenticated 
RPC, where the client chooses a protection level that is then
applied automatically to all data transferred in either direction,
applications that use GSSAPI must explicitly protect data on a
message-by-message basis.
This allows an application the option of protecting only particularly
sensitive messages, and avoids the overhead of security processing for other
messages.
(That is possible with RPC too, of course, provided that the programmer
is willing to specify security attributes on an RPC call-by-call basis.)
</Para>
<Para>GSSAPI offers two distinct types of protection through the <Function>gss_sign()</Function>/
<Function>gss_verify()</Function> routines and the <Function>gss_seal()</Function>/<Function>gss_unseal()</Function>
routines, as follows:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>The <Function>gss_sign()</Function> routine creates a token containing an encrypted
signature to
protect the integrity of the message data.  The token contains only the
signature (not the message data).  The application must send both the
token and the message to which
it applies to the peer application for verification.  The receiving application
calls the <Function>gss_verify()</Function> routine to check the signature.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>The <Literal>gss_seal( )</Literal> routine creates a token containing both an
encrypted signature
and the message data, and may optionally encrypt the message data.  Only
the token need
be sent to the peer application, which processes it by using the
<Function>gss_unseal()</Function> routine to verify the signature and extract the message
data.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>Three distinct signature algorithms are supported by the per-message
protection routines.  An algorithm may be requested by providing one of
several constants to the <Literal>qop_request</Literal> parameter (<Literal>qop</Literal> stands

<Para>Authentication protocols assume the availability of a data encryption
mechanism, parameterized by a so-called <FirstTerm>crypto-variable</FirstTerm> or <FirstTerm>key</FirstTerm>.
In fact, it is the knowledge of such a key that is the concrete
manifestation of the abstract notion of authentication.
One mechanism that is frequently used is the Data Encryption
Standard (DES), though the DCE security architecture supports other
cryptographic algorithms.
Your version of DCE security may use DES for data privacy
or for principal authentication and data-integrity checking; or
it may use another encryption mechanism, or no encryption at all.
Consult the documentation supplied by your DCE vendor for specific
information.

<Para RevisionFlag="Changed">Public key authentication protocol works via public and private key-pairs.
A user's identity is proven to the DCE Key Distribution Center (KDC) through
a signature in the user's private authentication key. The KDC verifies the
request through the user's authentication public key, which must be contained
in the DCE registry. If the request is verified, the KDC replies with a TGT that
is first signed by the KDC using its own private authentication key, and then
is encrypted by the KDC using the client's key encipherment public key, which
must be stored in the DCE registry.
Because the KDC does not know the user's private keys, a compromise of the KDC 
cannot reveal the private keys. Therefore, public key
users will not have any identifying information exposed to an intruder. This
method of public and private key pair usage constitutes the public key protocol.

<ListItem>
<?sml-need 7>
<Para>The timestamp and conversation key 2 are encrypted by using the user's
secret key, which is derived from the user's password (and subsequently
reencrypted by using conversation key 1).  This enables the authentication
service
to verify that the requesting client knows the user's password.
(It does this by decrypting the package via
the registry service's copy of the
user's secret key; if the decryption succeeds, the keys are the same,
that is, they were derived from the same password.)
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>The authentication service actively verifies whether the requesting
client knows the user's password.
Contrast this with the DCE Version 1.0 protocol, 
where the authentication service blindly issues
TGTs without requiring any evidence that the requestor knows the user's
password.  It is therefore aware of, and can manage, persistent login failures
for a given user, eliminating active password-guessing attacks.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>The authentication service's reply is encrypted by using conversation 
key 2, which was provided by the client.  This verifies to the client 
that the authentication service itself is
authentic since, if it were not, it would not have been able to obtain
the machine session key and user's secret key it needed to
decrypt conversation key 2.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<Para>These safeguards provide assurance to both server and client that the
entity with which each is communicating is, in fact, what it claims to be.

<Para>Upon receiving the request for
a TGT, the authentication service obtains the user's secret key from
the registry service database (where the secret keys of all principals in
the cell are stored).  Using its own secret key (that is, that of the KDS),
the authentication service encrypts the user's identity, along 
with a conversation key 3
(this conversation key 3 is the same as conversation key 3 in
the discussion of the third-party protocol, earlier in this chapter),
in a TGT.  The authentication service separately encrypts a copy of
conversation key 3 with the user's secret key and returns this data to
the client.

<Para>When this data arrives at the client,
the login tool prompts the user for the password

password to the client's security
runtime library.  The security runtime derives the user's secret key
from the password (using a well-known algorithm), and uses it to decrypt
conversation key 3. (If the user
enters the wrong password, this decryption fails.)
The client's security runtime cannot decrypt
the TGT since it does not know the KDS's secret
key.  The TGT is the client principal's certificate of identity&mdash;it
is usable by the client precisely because the client knows the
conversation key 3 carried in it.

<Note>
<Para>One of the functions of <Function>sec_login_valid_and_cert_ident()</Function> is to
authenticate the authentication service itself to the host machine's
login program, by demonstrating that the (purported) authentication service really knows
the secret key of the host computer.
(The mere fact that the purported authentication service knew the user's
secret key is not convincing to the host's login program, because that
purported authentication service could have been a bogus server working in league with a
bogus user&mdash;the host doesn't trust any of these things.)

<Para>When the client's security runtime has succeeded in decrypting
conversation key 3, it next wants to acquire a
PTGT from the privilege service.  Before a request for a PTGT
can even be formulated, however, a service ticket to the privilege service
must be acquired.
The client's security runtime therefore begins by requesting such a
service ticket from the TGS.
The security runtime encrypts this request by using the conversation key 3
(which is also sealed in the client's TGT); it also sends along the
client's TGT.
</Para>

<ListItem>
<?sml-need 15>
<Para>The TGS decrypts the TGT (which was encrypted in the KDS's secret key),
learning conversation key 3, and verifies that the request was properly
encrypted by using conversation key 3.
This convinces the TGS that the identity of the requesting client
is authentic; that is, no other principal could have sent a message
so encrypted because no other principal knows conversation key 3.
(The reader should review the preceding steps if necessary to be
convinced that this is true.)
Since the user has demonstrated to the TGS knowledge
of the key, the TGS allows the user to talk to the privilege service,
and so prepares a service ticket to that service.  This
ticket contains the identity of the user (and a conversation
key 4), encrypted under the secret key of the privilege service (which
the TGS retrieves from the registry service).
The TGS separately encrypts conversation key 4 under conversation key 3,
and returns this data to the client.

<Para>Upon receipt of this data, the client's security runtime uses
conversation key 3 to decrypt conversation key 4.
The client then formulates a request for a PTGT, encrypting it with
conversation key 4, and sends this together with the service ticket it just
received from the TGS, to the privilege service.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>The privilege service decrypts the service ticket sent to it (using its
secret key), thereby learning the
identity of the client and the conversation key 4 it will use to decrypt
the request and to encrypt its response.  The privilege service is convinced
of the authenticity of this request because the
information was encrypted under its own secret key, and no principal other
than the KDS (acting as the TGS) could have encrypted the information
by using this secret key.  Because the privilege service believes the
authenticity of the client's identity, it prepares an
extended privilege attribute certificate (EPAC) to issue to the client.
(Actually, in the pure DCE Version 1.0 protocol this would be a PAC, 
not an EPAC, but since this is a high-level description intended for 
both releases we'll just talk about EPACs without fear of confusion.  
So what we're really describing here is an extended privilege 
TGT, or EPTGT, though we'll continue to call it a PTGT.)
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 18>The EPAC describes the user's privilege attributes (identity information
and group membership) and any extended attributes that are associated
with the user&mdash;all represented as UUIDs (not strings).
The EPAC (or EPAC chain, in case of a delegated operation) is sealed with 
an MD5 checksum.  (Delegation is described in Chapter 27.)  The privilege 
service constructs a PTGT, which is a ticket that contains
the EPAC, the EPAC seal, another copy of the EPAC seal encrypted in the
secret key of the privilege service (this is called a <FirstTerm>delegation
token</FirstTerm>), and a conversation key 5 (which is actually generated by the
KDS, though the illustration doesn't show this detail).
All this information except for the EPAC itself is encrypted in the
secret key of the KDS (thus, the delegation token is doubly encrypted).
(The KDS and privilege service cooperate to prepare the PTGT, although
the illustration only shows the privilege service preparing it.)
The EPAC seal inside the PTGT binds the EPAC to the PTGT,
guaranteeing its integrity even though it isn't encrypted.
The conversation key 5 is encrypted in conversation key 4, and all this
data is returned to the client.

<Title>Identities in a Delegation Chain</Title>
<!---->
<Para>When a user who has initiated delegation (with
<Function>sec_login_become_initiator()</Function>)
makes an authenticated RPC to the next member in a delegation chain
(the first intermediary), the initiator passes its PTGT (including EPAC,
seal and delegation token) to the TGS, and receives an extended
privilege service ticket (again containing EPAC, seal and delegation
token) to the intermediary.  This is passed to the intermediary.
The intermediary then invokes either routine
<Function>sec_login_become_delegate()</Function> or <Function>sec_login_become_impersonator()</Function>,
passing to the privilege service the authorization information it
received from the initiator (EPAC and delegation token), together with
the intermediary's own PTGT (including the intermediary's EPAC, seal and
delegation token).
</Para>
<Para RevisionFlag="Changed">The privilege service uses the two delegation tokens, which are
seals over the initiator's and intermediary's EPAC encrypted in the
privilege service's own secret key, to verify the authenticity of the EPACs.
If these are valid,
the privilege service creates an EPAC chain, consisting of the initiator's and
intermediary's EPACs, and
generates a new seal and delegation token for this EPAC chain, and
returns to the intermediary a new PTGT containing this information.
Thus, the intermediary's authorization information
now includes both EPACs in the delegation chain and a PTGT that contains
the EPAC chain's seal and delegation token.
The subsequent additions of identities to
the delegation chain are handled in the same manner, resulting in PTGTs
with each intermediary's identity being added to the EPAC chain.
Any such PTGT can be used to continue the delegation chain or to
acquire a service ticket to the ultimate target server.

 from client
to server (and the remote call is of course protected with conversation key
6).  In the CL (datagram) RPC protocol, on the other hand, while the
first remote call from client to server is protected as previously described 
(with conversation key 6), the credentials themselves are not sent with
the remote call.  Instead, the server itself <FirstTerm>pulls</FirstTerm> the credentials, by
performing a <FirstTerm>callback</FirstTerm>, that is, a reverse (system-level) RPC back to

server) itself, as in the preceding walkthroughs.

conversation key 6, they cache it and continue to use it for subsequent

keys are accompanied by an expiration time, beyond which a new
conversation key must be established (via a new service ticket, or
perhaps even a new TGT if that expires, as described in the preceding

minimal, namely, it is reduced merely to the overhead of
encryption/decryption processing itself, without the protocol
message-passing.

<Title>KDS Surrogates</Title>
<Para>A principal trusts the DCE Security Service 
(registry service/KDS/privilege service) to
authenticate other principals in its cell because it trusts the
cryptographic algorithms and protocols, and the security of the code and
data of the security service itself (which is trusted because it is
part of the DCE network trusted computing base).  
The DCE Security Service can authenticate all principals in
its cell because it shares a secret key with each of them.  
A client principal
that wants to talk to a <Symbol Role="Variable">foreign</Symbol>
server principal (that is, a principal in
another cell) must acquire a ticket targeted to that server.  As always,
such a ticket must be encrypted in the secret key of the foreign server,
else the server will not trust the ticket.
The client cannot get such a ticket from its own local security service,
because only the foreign security service, not
local security service, knows the secret
key of the foreign server.  Therefore, some means must be devised
by which the two instances of the security service can
securely convey information about their respective principals to one
another (without actually divulging secret keys of principals to foreign
security services, which would be a security risk).
</Para>
<Para>Besides the fact that it is trusted <FirstTerm>a priori</FirstTerm>, a cell's KDS
is an exceptional principal in this other respect: other kinds
of principals share their secret keys with the local security
service, whereas the KDS's key is private to the KDS; that is, it
is known to no other principal.  Thus, one problem that intercell
authentication must overcome
is the means by which the KDS in one cell may trust
that in another cell without either of them having to share
their private keys (which would again introduce an unacceptable
security risk).
</Para>
<Note>
<?sml-need 11>
<Para>With respect to cryptographic keys, the term <FirstTerm>secret</FirstTerm> refers to keys
that are (securely) shared between a bounded set of two (or more)

a single principal, and <FirstTerm>public</FirstTerm> to keys that are known to an

<Para><?sml-need 13>The solution to this problem is a small extension of the shared-secret
authentication model previously discussed in this chapter.  Namely,
a new principal is invented specifically for cross-cell authentication,

It is through their surrogates that the two instances of the KDS
can convey information about their respective principals
to one another (though the two KDSs never communicate directly with one
another, nor do the surrogates), thus enabling a client principal from
one cell to acquire a ticket to a server principal in another cell.
</Para>
<Para>An authentication surrogate is a true principal in the sense that it is
represented by an entry in a registry service database, but it is not an autonomous
participant in authenticated communications in the same sense that,
for example, a client or a server is.  Rather, it is more like an <FirstTerm>alias</FirstTerm>
that is assumed by a cell's KDS when it communicates with foreign clients.
The establishment, via surrogates, of a trust peer relationship
between two cells is an <FirstTerm>explicit</FirstTerm> expression of mutual trust in the

authentication.  Upon receiving this request,
the foreign TGS decrypts it by using the surrogate's secret key, and

possible for the two TGSs to cooperate in this way.)

ticket to that server (as previously described).
Similarly, the client principal may reuse the XPTGT
to acquire service tickets to any other servers in the foreign cell.
