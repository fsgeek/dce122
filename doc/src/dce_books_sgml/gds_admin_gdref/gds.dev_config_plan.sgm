<Para>Before attempting to initialize and configure the directory service,
the administrator must develop a configuration

Appendix F contains a set of worksheets that administrators can copy
for their own use.  Administrators are not obliged to use
every worksheet; they are provided to help
to organize the information required to initialize and
configure GDS and to make modifications at a later date.
</Para>
<Para>After filling out the worksheets, the administrator is ready to
perform a GDS configuration.  The next chapter describes how to use
this information to install and configure GDS.
</Para>
<Para>In order to explain how a typical administrator works through the 
configuration process, this chapter refers to a 
hypothetical branch administrator, Branch Adminstrator 4,
who is developing a plan to integrate a cell into GDS.
Branch Administrator 4 is setting up the directory service for a 
branch office of a large corporation, called the XYZ Corporation. 
The configuration consists of four
machines: two clients and two client/servers.  The two
client/server machines have the DSAs <Literal>dsa-ops</Literal> and <Literal>dsa-employ</Literal>.
</Para>
<Para>The initial DSA for the administrative domain containing
<Literal>dsa-ops</Literal> is <Literal>dsa-HQ</Literal>.  This DSA is
administered by the corporate network administrator, 
Corporate Administrator 1, who is located at corporate 
headquarters in a different city than Branch Administrator 4.
</Para>
<Para>The first-level DSA is administered by a global naming authority
(described in the following section) and is called
<Literal>dsa-us</Literal> in this example.

<Para>To enable a DCE cell to communicate with other cells in the global
naming environment, an administrator needs to obtain a globally unique
cell name.  The name either exists already or is specially created for this purpose.
To obtain a unique GDS cell name, an administrator contacts the other
administrator in charge of the section of the DIT
under which the cell is to be named.  In the United States, the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) delegates X.500 names subordinate to the entry /<Literal>C=US</Literal>.
</Para>
<Para>Administrators are encouraged to obtain
a unique global name for a cell even if the cell does not initially
use GDS to communicate with other cells.
This enables the cell to participate subsequently in a global naming
service. 
</Para>
<Para>In the sample configuration scenario, Corporate Administrator 1 in
charge of network operations for XYZ Corporation applies to ANSI
to reserve <Literal>XYZ</Literal> as a unique organization name.
Later, as one of the
first steps in establishing a cell, Branch Administrator 4 contacts Corporate 
Administrator 1 and asks to reserve the global name <Literal>Branch4</Literal>, which is used to
create a cell entry <Literal>/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4</Literal> in GDS.  Finally, 
Branch Administrator 4 again applies to Corporate Administrator 1 to reserve 
the names <Literal>dsa-employ</Literal> and
<Literal>dsa-ops</Literal> to establish the entry names for the two DSAs:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para><Literal>/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4/CN=dsa/CN=dsa-employ</Literal>
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para><Literal>/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4/CN=dsa/CN=dsa-ops</Literal>
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>If all directory requests that originate from <Literal>dsa-employ</Literal> and
<Literal>dsa-ops</Literal> remain within XYZ Corporation, Branch Administrator 4 
only needs to be registered with Corporate Administrator 1 (that is, within XYZ
Corporation).  In this case, Branch Administrator 4 makes sure that 
Corporate Administrator 1 at corporate
headquarters creates a shadow entry of <Literal>dsa-employ</Literal> and
<Literal>dsa-ops</Literal> on <Literal>dsa-HQ</Literal>.  This way, Branch Administrator 4's 
DSAs can communicate
with other DSAs through <Literal>dsa-HQ</Literal>.
</Para>
<Para>Branch Administrator 4 also needs to make sure that a shadow of 
<Literal>dsa-HQ</Literal> is present on
<Literal>dsa-ops</Literal> and <Literal>dsa-employ</Literal> so that these DSAs can access other
DSAs in the XYZ Corporation.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 12>If Branch Administrator 4 expects the DSAs to participate in the directory service
outside of XYZ Corporation, <Literal>dsa-employ</Literal> and <Literal>dsa-ops</Literal> must be
known by DSAs outside of XYZ Corporation.  If shadow entries of
<Literal>dsa-employ</Literal> and <Literal>dsa-ops</Literal> exist on <Literal>dsa-HQ</Literal>, most DSAs
can contact Branch Administrator 4's DSAs through <Literal>dsa-HQ</Literal>.  
However, if Branch Administrator 4's
users need to access these remote DSAs frequently, 
Branch Administrator 4 should
consider contacting administrators of DSAs outside XYZ Corporation
directly and arranging for mutual shadow entries to be present on their
respective DSAs.  This would reduce the overhead of referrals and
chained requests over the network.  In addition, <Literal>dsa-employ</Literal> and
<Literal>dsa-ops</Literal> need to have a copy of <Literal>dsa-us</Literal> (the first-level DSA)
to communicate worldwide.

<Para>Each GDS entry is uniquely and unambiguously identified by a DN.
The administrator must determine the DN of each DSA in the cell (or
cells) that the administrator is responsible for in order to add these
DNs to the directory.

<Para>For example, Branch Administrator 4 knows that the DN for  XYZ
Corporation is <Literal>/C=US/O=XYZ</Literal>, and that the DN
of the cell is <Literal>/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4</Literal>.  Branch
Administrator  4 has applied for and received the names of the two DSAs:

<Para>GDS software is delivered with the GDS standard schema.  It contains
the directory classes and attributes specified in the X.500
standard, the GDS extensions, and, optionally, the electronic mail
package (X.400).  An administrator sometimes needs to add object classes
and attributes that are required by other applications to the schema.
</Para>
<Para>For example, Branch Administrator 4 decides to install a new software
package to monitor computer facilities.  This package
requires directory classes
and attributes that are not part of the current schema.  The new
program is being implemented across XYZ Corporation.  
Corporate Administrator 1 has set up the directory so that 
responsibility for administering
the schema resides at XYZ
Corporation headquarters (<Literal>dsa-HQ</Literal> is the initial DSA and 
therefore masters the schema object).  Branch Administrator 4 cannot 
make any changes to the schema without
submitting a request to Corporate Administrator 1's  office.  
Branch Administrator 4
contacts Corporate Administrator 1 and 
provides the values for the entries in the
OCT, SRT, and AT for these new object classes and attributes.  
Corporate Administrator 1 adds the
new object classes and attributes to the schema.

<Para>Corporate Administrator 1 also must use shadow administration 
functions to make sure that

<Para>These access classes are not related in a hierarchical order; they are

attributes, this does not imply access rights for standard attributes.  Each
access right must be explicitly assigned.

<Para>An administrator must also determine the access that users require for object
entries.  The administrator assigns directory users to the 
specific access classes by

administration program (described in Chapter 8).

<Para>For example, the Personnel Department is responsible for the public
and private data associated with each employee of the branch office.
The personnel manager has given Branch Administrator 4
a list of information that should
be made available to all employees at the branch office.  This list
includes telephone numbers, fax numbers, and so on.  
The personnel manager requests that only certain people have
the ability to modify telephone and fax numbers in the directory.  Another list

directly from the master.  In this case, the administrator must
keep the master entry on a machine close to users (avoiding network
access where possible).  If users at other sites require frequent access,

shadows can be created at these other sites.

<Para>An administrator also needs to determine how often shadows are
updated.  The frequency depends on user requirements and 
the types of applications that need access to the directory.
</Para>
<Para>For example, employee phone numbers do not change frequently.  If
employees within a small company do not change addresses that often,
the shadow update frequency could be low; for example,
daily or even weekly.  However, if XYZ Corporation is

employees worldwide, shadowing would be required on a more frequent
basis.

<Para>The <Literal>X500_DSA_Admin</Literal> attribute is only necessary for adminstrators
