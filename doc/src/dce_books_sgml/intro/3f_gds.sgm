<Title>DCE Global Directory Service</Title>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3F.indx.1" Significance="Preferred">
<Primary>GDS</Primary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>DCE GDS is a directory service implementation
based on the international standard CCITT X.500/ISO 9594.
When present in a DCE cell, GDS can serve two basic functions.
First, it can participate in a high-level, possibly worldwide
directory service tying together independent DCE cells.
Second, it can be used as an additional directory service to CDS for
storing object names and attributes in a central place.
</Para>
<Para>Like CDS, GDS is a replicated, distributed
database.
The GDS database
contains information that can be distributed over several
GDS servers.
In addition, copies of information can be stored in multiple GDS
servers,
and the information can also be cached.
The unit of replication in GDS is the directory entry (whole subtrees
can also be specified).
</Para>
<Para>The GDS directory is structured differently from CDS, and names
are also different in that they are typed, as described later.
Programmers can access
both DCE Directory Services, however,
using the X/Open Directory Service API
(see Section 3.3.5.2 for a description
of XDS).
</Para>
<Para>The following subsections describe the GDS components, possible
GDS configurations,
the GDS database and names,
an overview of how GDS works, and the relationship of DCE GDS to
underlying network services and international standards.

It is the server side of GDS.
In order to handle simultaneous requests from different

processes.

<Para>The DUA is a library that implements the GDS client;
this library is present on all GDS client machines.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Directory User Agent cache
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3F.indx.7">
<Primary>caching</Primary>
<Secondary>in GDS</Secondary>
</IndexTerm></Para>
<Para>This process keeps a cache of information obtained
from DSAs.
One DUA cache runs on each client machine and is used by
all the users on that machine.
The DUA cache contains copies of recently accessed object
entries and information about DSAs.
The programmer specifies which information should be cached, and it
is possible to bypass the DUA cache to obtain
information directly from a DSA.
This is desirable, for example, when the user wants to make sure
the information obtained is up-to-date.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>C-Stub and S-Stub
</Para>
<Para>The C-Stub process runs on each client machine and manages
communications with DSAs.
It implements the upper layers of the ISO protocol stack
(see Section 3.3.3.5).
Its function is similar to the RPC runtime (GDS uses OSI protocols
instead of DCE RPC).
The S-Stub is similar to the C-Stub, except it runs on the server
machine and manages its communications with DUAs and other DSAs.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Shadow update and cache update processes
</Para>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3F.indx.8">
<Primary>consistency</Primary>
<Secondary>in GDS</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>Unlike the processes listed previously, which run continuously,
the processes for updating replicas in DSAs and DUA caches
run as needed and then terminate.
The shadow update process runs on the GDS server machine; the
cache update process runs on GDS client machines.
<?sml-break><?sml-need 8></Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>The GDS administration programs
</Para>
<Para>DCE GDS continues to provide three programs for administering 
its service.
The <Command>gdssysadm</Command> program supports administration of the local GDS 
installation, such as configuration, server activation, and backup.
The <Command>gdsditadm</Command> program supports remote administration of the 
contents of a GDS database.  Finally, the <Command>gdscacheadm</Command>
program supports the administration of the contents of the local DUA
cache.
</Para>
<Para>For Release 1.1, GDS also provides the <Command>gdscp</Command> and <Command>gdssetup</Command>
programs.  The <Command>gdscp</Command> program allows the administrator to enter 
object administration functions by using command-line and interactive modes.
It can be used as an alternative to the Object Administration 
menu interface and part of the Cache Administration menu interface 
of the GDS administration program.
</Para>
<Para>The <Command>gdssetup</Command> command provides the administrator with an interface to
simplify the process of creating and initializing a directory
configuration.  The other method of creating and initializing a
directory configuration requires that the administrator perform
initialization steps by using the masks of the <Command>gdsditadm</Command> program
either manually or by using batch file scripts.
</Para>
<Para>The advantages of both of these programs are described in the &DCEAx;.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>Figure 3-11 shows the interaction between the directory service
application, the XDS interface, and the GDS client
and server.
The GDS client and server use the Directory Access Protocol (DAP)
to communicate.
The GDS servers use the Directory System Protocol (DSP) to communicate
with one another.
DAP and DSP perform functions similar to the function that the DCE RPC
protocols perform
in other DCE services.
The DAP and DSP protocols are defined in the X.500 standard, enabling
worldwide interoperability among directory services.

</Para>
<Para>A machine can be configured with both the GDS client and server.
This is the typical configuration for a machine acting
as a GDS server.
This configuration can be useful even if a node acts mainly as a client
because the DSA can be used as a larger, more permanent cache
of information contained in remote DSAs.

is an entry in the database that names and describes an
object, such as a person, machine, or server.
It consists of one or more attributes, and each of the
attributes has a type and a value.
For example, an attribute type might be <Literal>COMMON NAME</Literal> (or <Literal>CN</Literal>)
and the value might be snowpaws; another attribute might be type
<Literal>MACHINE ADDRESS</Literal> and the value might be <Literal>100.100.1.177</Literal>.
Some attributes may have more than one value.
Each object entry has an attribute of type <Literal>OBJECT CLASS</Literal>, and
its value specifies what the object's class is, which
determines what other attributes the object entry has.
The name of an entry consists of one or more of its attributes
(see Figure 3-13).

Each object entry has an ACL associated with it.
It specifies permission to access the object's attributes.
The attributes can be classified as <Literal>PUBLIC</Literal>, <Literal>STANDARD</Literal>, or

<Para>When an application
program makes a GDS call using the XDS API,
the call is handed to the DUA library.
The DUA first looks in the DUA cache (if specified)

If it is not, the DUA queries a DSA.
The DSA may have the requested information and, if it does, it returns
the results to the DUA.
If it does not, the query can proceed in one of two ways.
Either the DSA can query a different DSA on behalf of the DUA,

<Para>The X.500 directory service standard was written to run
on top of the OSI communications protocols.
The OSI protocols are divided into seven layers:
the Physical,
Data Link,
Network,
Transport,
Session,
Presentation, and
Application Layers (see Figure 3-14).
The upper three layers are usually implemented as libraries that are
linked together with the application process.
The lower layers are part of the operating system, and their services are
made available to the upper layers through a transport interface.
The transport interface is the double line in Figure 3-14.

</Figure>
<!-- .so intro/pic/3f_gds_12.pic-->
<?sml-space .5>
<Para>The directory service is an application layer protocol.
Its specification requires the use of the underlying
layers and two other Application Layer
service elements: 
Association Control Service Element (ACSE) and
Remote Operation Service Element (ROSE).  ROSE and 
ACSE of Layer 7, and the presentation service of Layer 6,
are implemented in GDS by the Remote Operation Service 
(ROS) library.
The OSI Session Service (Layer 5) is implemented in GDS by the
OSI Session Service (OSS) library.
These layers are equivalent to the communications
support supplied by the DCE RPC runtime system,
which also fills in the gap between
an application and the underlying transport communications.
Although GDS supplies support for these upper OSI layers,
they are used only for the directory service
and are not made available for application programmers.
</Para>
<Para>DCE assumes that the system it runs on provides support
for transport layer communications (either OSI transport
or IP transport).
The OSI protocols running above the transport layer were
originally designed to run over OSI transport protocols.
Many DCE systems run TCP/IP, so GDS provides
the capability for running over the TCP/IP transport protocol
as specified in RFC 1006.
</Para>
<Para>The GDS software includes
a compiler and a runtime library called
MAVROS.
The compiler takes specifications written in the Abstract
Syntax Notation (ASN.1) and compiles them into C language code for
header files and encoding/decoding routines,
much as the RPC IDL compiler takes an IDL
specification and compiles it into a header file and
client and server stubs.
MAVROS is used to encode/decode the DAP and DSP protocols and their data
values.
