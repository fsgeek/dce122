</IndexTerm>
<Para>OSF's Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) provides services
and tools
that support the creation, use, and maintenance of distributed
applications in a heterogeneous computing environment.
This chapter provides an overview of DCE, beginning with a
section describing distributed computing and its benefits.
The next section describes three distributed computing
models&mdash;client/server, remote procedure call (RPC), and data sharing.
The final section gives an overview of DCE itself, describing
its technology components, the organization of a DCE environment, and the
relationship between DCE and the underlying computing system.

</IndexTerm>
<Para>By ``distributed computing'' we mean computing that involves the cooperation
of two or more machines communicating
over a network (see Figure 1-1).
The machines participating in the system can range from personal
computers to supercomputers; the network can connect machines in
one building or on different continents.

<!-- .so intro/pic/1_overview_00.pic-->
<?sml-space .5>
<Para>Why is enabling this type of cooperative computing
important?
One reason is historical: computing resources that used to operate
independently
now need to work together.
For example, consider an office that
acquired personal workstations for individual use.
After a while, there were
many workstations in the office building, and the users recognized that
it would be desirable to share data and resources among the individual
computers.
They accomplished this by connecting the workstations over
a network.
</Para>
<Para>A second reason is functional: if there is special-function hardware or
software available over the network, then that functionality does not
have to be duplicated on every computer system (or <Replaceable>node</Replaceable>)
that needs to access the special-purpose resource.
For example, an organization could make a typesetting service
available over the network,
allowing users throughout the organization to submit their jobs to be
typeset.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 6>A third reason is economical: it may be more cost effective to have
many small computers working together than one large computer of
equivalent power.  In addition, having many units connected to a network
is the more flexible configuration, because if more resources are needed,
another unit can be added in place,
rather than bringing the whole system down and replacing
it with an upgraded one.
</Para>
<Para>Finally, a distributed system
can be more reliable and available than a centralized system.  This
is a result of the ability to replicate both data and functionality.
For example, when a given file is copied on two different machines, then
even if one
machine is unavailable, the file can still be accessed on the other
machine.  Likewise, if several printers are attached to a network,
then even if an administrator takes one printer
offline for maintenance, users can
still print their files by using an alternate printer.
</Para>
<Para>Distributed computing inherently brings with it not only
potential advantages, but also new problems.
Examples are keeping multiple copies of data consistent,
and keeping the clocks on different machines in the system synchronized.
A system that provides distributed computing support must address these
new issues.
</Para>
<Sect2 Id="ITODCE.OVRV.div.3">
<Title>Why DCE?</Title>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.OVRV.indx.4">
<Primary>DCE</Primary>
<Secondary>motivation</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>Given that, for one of the reasons previously mentioned or some other reason,
an organization decides that it wants to acquire distributed computing
capability,
why is DCE in particular advantageous?
Why would an organization with a network such as the one in Figure 1-1
benefit from using DCE to enable distributed computing?
</Para>
<Para>DCE's benefits can be categorized into
its support of distributed applications,
the integration of its components with each other,
DCE's relationship to its platforms,
its support for data sharing,
and DCE's interaction with the world
outside of DCE, as described in the following list.
<?sml-break><?sml-need 11></Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>DCE provides tools and services that support distributed applications.
</Para>
<Para>DCE provides
a high-level, coherent environment
for developing and running applications on a distributed system.
The DCE components fall into two categories: tools for developing
distributed applications, and services for running distributed
applications.
The tools, such as DCE RPC and DCE Threads,
assist in the development of an application.
The services, such as the DCE Directory Service, Security Service,
and Distributed Time Service,
provide the support required in a distributed system that is analogous
to the support an operating system provides in a centralized system.
</Para>
<Para>It is
<Replaceable>possible</Replaceable>
to develop distributed applications with much less
assistance than what DCE offers.
Programmers can write applications that cooperate across machines by
explicitly writing the code that performs the network communications
between them, but
this requires much time and expertise.
Programmers can also write distributed
applications by using a communications tool, such as
remote procedure call, while explicitly using other necessary technologies,
like standalone name and security services.  However, DCE provides a set
of components necessary for distributed computing that are already
integrated, and that do as much work as possible automatically for the
application programmer, system administrator, and end user.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>DCE's set of services is integrated and comprehensive.
</Para>
<Para>A second benefit is the integration and comprehensiveness of the DCE
components.
Not only does DCE provide all the tools and services needed for
developing and running distributed applications, but the DCE components
themselves are well integrated.
They use one another's services whenever possible, since many of the
DCE components are themselves distributed applications.
In addition to supporting the development of distributed applications,
DCE includes services that address some of the new problems inherent in the
distributed system itself, such as data consistency and clock
synchronization.
Finally, DCE includes management tools for administering all of
the DCE services and many aspects of the distributed environment itself.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<?sml-need 15>
<Para>DCE provides interoperability and portability across heterogeneous platforms.
</Para>
<Para>A benefit of DCE is its
orientation toward heterogeneous rather than homogeneous
systems.
One way to implement a distributed system is to
use a single operating system that runs
on all nodes participating in the distributed network.  The DCE architecture,
however, allows for different operating systems and hardware platforms.
Using DCE, a process running on one computer can interoperate with a
process on a second computer, even when the two computers have different
hardware or operating systems.
DCE can therefore
accommodate a wider range of networks&mdash;especially networks
needing distributed computing for the historical reasons previously
listed&mdash;than a model that requires the same operating system running on
every node.
Applications that are built using DCE are portable to other
hardware/operating system platforms that run DCE.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>DCE supports data sharing.
</Para>
<Para>Another benefit is DCE's support of data sharing through its directory
service and distributed
file service.
A user anywhere in the distributed system can share data by placing it
in the namespace or in a file, whichever is appropriate for
the application.
The data is then accessible by authorized users throughout the
system.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>DCE participates in a global computing environment.
</Para>
<Para>One final benefit of DCE is the way it interacts with
the outside world.
In addition to supporting cooperation within and between themselves, DCE
systems
can also interoperate with computing environments outside of DCE.
In particular, the DCE Directory Service can interoperate with two
standard, global directory services&mdash;X.500 and Domain Name
Service (DNS)&mdash;allowing users from within DCE
to access information about the outside world.
In this way, DCE participates in a global directory service.
One benefit of such participation can be seen in DCE's distributed file
system: it looks like one global file system, and users anywhere in
the world can address the same file by using the same global name.

<Primary>DCE</Primary>
<Secondary>potential users</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>This section gives some examples of computing environments
that can profit from distributed computing capabilities.
In general, any computing organization wishing to take
advantage of the benefits of a distributed computing environment&mdash;data
and resource sharing, extensibility, availability, interoperability&mdash;can
benefit from using DCE.
For example:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>An office with isolated computing resources can network
the computers together and use DCE for data and resource sharing.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>An organization consisting of multiple computing sites
that are already
interconnected by a network can
use DCE to
tie together
and access resources across the different sites.
The different sites can be in different countries, or even on different
continents.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Any computing
organization comprising, or expecting to comprise in the future,
more cooperating hosts than can be easily administered
manually (perhaps over a dozen nodes) can benefit greatly from the
administrative
support afforded by a DCE environment.
For example, in DCE the database of
computer users and their associated information (such as passwords) can be
administered centrally, removing the need for an administrator to
update information on every single node in the network each time a
new user is added.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Organizations that write distributed
applications can use DCE as a platform for their software.
Applications that are written on DCE can be readily ported to
other software and hardware platforms that also support DCE.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Organizations wishing to use applications that run on DCE
platforms.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Organizations that wish to participate in networked computing on
a global basis.
Since DCE supports
standard directory services that will be used throughout the world,
a site
that participates in DCE will be able to plug into that worldwide
directory service database,
allowing it to both ``see'' and access information about other
sites and organizations around the world.
In turn, it will be able to add itself
to the directory service, allowing itself to be ``seen''
and accessed, if desired, by other sites worldwide.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>System vendors whose customers are in any
of the preceding categories.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Organizations that would like to make a service available over the
network on one system (for example, a system running a non-UNIX
operating system), and have it accessible from other
kinds of systems (for example, workstations running UNIX).

DCE is based on three distributed computing models&mdash;client/server,
remote procedure call, and data sharing.
The client/server model is a way of organizing a distributed
application.
The remote procedure call model is a way of communicating between parts
of a distributed application.
The data sharing model is a way of handling data in a distributed

</IndexTerm>A useful model for implementing distributed

In this model, the
distributed application is divided into two parts, one part

<?sml-space .5>
<Para>The

The

side of the application is
the part that resides on the node that receives and executes the
distributed request (for example, the node with the printer).
In this model, two different sets of code are produced&mdash;one
that runs as a client, the other as a server.

</IndexTerm>The terms <Replaceable>client</Replaceable> and <Replaceable>server</Replaceable> are also used to refer to specific

This can be confusing since
a given node, or even a given process, can be acting in both the client and
server role.  Nevertheless, it is often
convenient to use the term <FirstTerm>file server</FirstTerm>
when referring to
the node on which the server side of a distributed file

requests for access to those names.
When clarification is needed, we use the term <Replaceable>machine</Replaceable>
to indicate the node rather than the role.
For example, in Figure 1-4, the print server, which runs on the print
server machine, is acting as a client to the file server.

<Para><?sml-need 5>One final distinction between client and server is that the server is
typically implemented as a continuous process (daemon); whereas the client

an application consists of a call to a routine that executes
(sending the request over the network and receiving the result)
and then returns and goes on with whatever else it was doing;
whereas the server side of an application is a dedicated process that
runs continuously&mdash;waiting for a request, executing it and returning the
answer, then waiting for the next request, and so on.

<Para>DCE is based on the client/server model.
The DCE services are themselves examples of distributed programs
with a client and server side.
The basic communications mechanism used in DCE, remote procedure
call, assumes the presence of a client and a server.
Since DCE applications are built using remote procedure call,
they are also based on the client/server model of distributed
computation.

</IndexTerm>One way of implementing communications between the client and server
sides of a distributed application is to use the procedure call model.
In this model, the client makes what looks like a procedure call.
The procedure call is translated into network communications by the
underlying RPC mechanism.
The server receives a request and executes the procedure, returning
the results to the client.
One of the DCE technology components, DCE RPC, is an implementation
of this model.
It is used by most of the other DCE technology components for their
network communications.

</IndexTerm>
<Para>Some of the DCE services are based on the <FirstTerm>data sharing</FirstTerm>
model, in which data is shared by distributing it throughout the
system.
Like RPC, data sharing assumes the existence of clients and servers.
Data sharing, however, focuses on distributed data rather than
distributed execution.
In RPC, the client's procedure is executed on the server.
In data sharing, the server's data is sent to the client.
For example, if a client wants to access a file,
a copy of the file is sent from the server to
the client.
The client then proceeds to access the file locally.
Data sharing can be built on top of RPC, using RPC as the communications
mechanism between the client and server, and as the means of transferring
data.
</Para>
<Para>Data sharing usually entails having multiple copies of the same data;
for example, a master copy of a file on a file server, and a copy
of the file on one or more client machines.
As a result, copies of data may diverge; that is, a client may make changes
to its copy that make the client's copy inconsistent with the copy on
the server.
Therefore, distributed services based on the data sharing model usually
include mechanisms for keeping copies of data consistent.
</Para>
<Para>In addition, services that implement data sharing must be able to
synchronize multiple access to data.
For example, two clients may each want to modify
a given record in a database.
The server that manages the database must either prevent them from
making conflicting modifications or decide which modification takes
precedence.

Both DCE directory services, CDS and GDS, maintain caches on

The caches contain copies of data that users on the client have
recently accessed.
Subsequent access to the data can be made locally to the cache,
rather than over the network to the server.

DFS servers distribute and revoke
tokens,
which represent a client's capability to perform operations
on files.
Through careful token management, the DFS server can ensure
that its clients do not perform conflicting operations on shared
files, and that they do not see inconsistent copies of the same
file.

DCE allows for a distributed object model in conjunction with the other 
DCE models to give a flexible way to distribute functionality and data 
for client/server applications.
In addition, a distributed object model <Symbol Role="Variable">combines</Symbol> appropriate 
functionality with data, by way of distributed objects, 
in a way that also hides how parts of the distributed application communicates.
</Para>
<Para>Objects are used to model the behavior of all sorts of application entities.  
In object-oriented terminology, an object is simply an instance of its class.  
Each object contains member functions (methods) that are only specified in 
the class as operations.  
In the distributed object model, a DCE interface is a public set of operations, 
but the methods of implementation are separate and application specific. 
(Data types are usually application specific but the interface 
can specify them as well.)   
A DCE interface specifies what is known as an abstract base class 
because the class has a public interface and a hidden implementation.
</Para>
<Para>Object-oriented applications make it easy to hide data and implementation 
details by using hierarchies of classes and other object-oriented features.
Thus object-oriented applications can help minimize the exposure of 
network details and the special DCE mechanisms of distributed computing.  
In DCE, the IDL compiler generates a class hierarchy for applications.
This hierarchy contains an interface class derived from a DCE RPC base class.
The interface class becomes part of an application in such a way
that the network details, mechanisms of data transfer, 
and object location are hidden (encapsulated) in the base class. 
</Para>
<Para>DCE interfaces have code generated in C++ to help implement 
a distributed object model.
This means that developers can write object-oriented applications 
in a more natural way using C++ directly without relying on 
inadequate or cumbersome C-to-C++ wrapper routines for DCE interfaces.
</Para>

<Para>A cell provides a single security domain.  Users log into

</Para>
<Para>DCE cells can be connected so that they can communicate with each other.
Going back to the example, if the different departments' cells are

this access would typically be less frequent and more

service, and the cell is then able to contact other cells
registered in that global service.  Note that communication
between DCE cells is not automatic.  Cells that wish to
communicate with each other must first establish a trust
relationship between their cells' security services;
this process is called <FirstTerm>cross-cell authentication</FirstTerm> and

The cell's primary name is the default name for the
cell; that is, it is the name that DCE services

Cell name aliasing permits a cell to be registered
in more than one global namespace.  It also provides
a way to change a cell's name if the need arises;

various DCE components each make use of the services of the other components
wherever possible.  For example, the RPC facility uses
the directory service to advertise and look up RPC-based servers and their
characteristics, it uses the security service to ensure message
integrity and privacy, and it uses DCE Threads to handle
concurrent execution of multiple RPCs.  DFS uses threads,
RPC, the directory service, DTS,

<Title>Ensuring Character and Code Set Interoperability</Title>
<Para>A <FirstTerm>character set</FirstTerm> is a group of characters, such as the English
alphabet, Japanese Kanji, or the European character set.
To enable world-wide connectivity, DCE guarantees that
a minimum group of characters is supported in the DCE.
The DCE RPC communications protocol ensures this guarantee
by requiring that all DCE RPC clients and servers support
the DCE Portable Character Set (PCS).  The set of DCE PCS characters
consists of the following:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>: ; &lt; = > ? @ [ ] &caret; _ ` ' ~ { | } ! " # $ % &amp; ( ) * + &ndash; . / &lt;space>

</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>A <Replaceable>code set</Replaceable> is a mapping of the members of a character set to
specific numeric code values.  Examples of code sets include ASCII,
EBCDIC, JIS X0208 (Japanese Kanji), and ISO 8859-1 (also known as
Latin-1.) The DCE RPC communications protocol automatically converts
DCE PCS characters between the ASCII and EBCDIC code sets, if
necessary.  DCE RPC also provides constructs and routines for
character and code set interoperability between non-PCS, or
international characters.  These features permit programmers
to write DCE RPC applications that guarantee character and code
set interoperability between clients and servers in a DCE that
supports a variety of languages and encodings for those languages.
</Para>
</Sect3>
<Sect3 Id="ITODCE.OVRV.div.20">
<Title>Preserving Character Data Integrity</Title>
<Para>The DCE components preserve character data integrity because they
do not use, or ``mask off,'' the eighth bit of a character for any
purpose.  In addition, DCE RPC does not modify user data in any way
when it is passed as <StructName Role="typedef">idl_byte</StructName> context,
unless the application is using the DCE RPC features for automatic
code set conversion of non-PCS characters.
</Para>
</Sect3>
<Sect3 Id="ITODCE.OVRV.div.21">
<Title>Ensuring Easy Localization of User-Visible Messages</Title>
<Para>The DCE components isolate all user-visible messages
into separate message catalogs.  Separating
DCE messages into distinct message catalogues makes it easier for DCE
licensees to localize DCE messages so that DCE users and administrators
can view DCE error messages and prompts in their native language.
