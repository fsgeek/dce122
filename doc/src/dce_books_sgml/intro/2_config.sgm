<Para>Chapter 1 gave some examples of organizations that could
benefit from a distributed computing environment.
The examples showed that
OSF DCE could be useful to organizations for widely varying reasons.
Similarly, one organization using DCE could require a DCE configuration
that is quite different from the DCE configuration that another
organization develops.
</Para>
<Para>This chapter gives an overview of DCE configuration.
It describes the basic DCE software
configuration components and how they are
organized on different types of DCE machines.
It then describes some typical DCE
cell configurations.
</Para>
<Para>The DCE configuration description in this chapter is based on
technical configuration considerations.
The packaging of DCE software by OSF and other vendors will
involve somewhat different configurations since the packaging is influenced by
additional considerations.

<Para>A distributed computing environment 
consists of machines that communicate over a network
and run DCE software.
The machines in a DCE environment serve different functions and can
therefore run different configurations of DCE software.

</IndexTerm>DCE software can be divided into several <Replaceable>configuration components</Replaceable>;
that is, parts of the DCE software that are installed in various
combinations on DCE machines.
Different configuration components
are installed on different machines
in a DCE environment, depending on what the machine's intended use is.
For example, a user's workstation that acts mainly as a client in the
DCE environment requires a different set of DCE software from a machine that
acts as a DFS file server.
</Para>
<Para>The following description is a model for dividing DCE services into
configuration components.
The way a service's implementation maps to this model varies from
service to service.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 4>First, each DCE service can be divided into two general categories
of functionality: user and administration.
The
<FirstTerm>user</FirstTerm>
functionality is the service provided to its users; for example,
reading a file or searching a database.
The
<Replaceable>administration</Replaceable>
functionality allows administrators to manage the server; for
example, stopping and starting server programs or backing up data.
</Para>
<Para>Since the DCE services are based on the client/server model,
both the user and administration functions are divided into
two parts: the client and server sides.
In total, each DCE technology component
can be conceptually divided into four configuration components:

<?sml-space .5>
<Para><?sml-need 5>The user client component is typically installed
on DCE users' workstations.
The administration client might run only on the workstation used
by the administrator of the service.
Both the user server and the administration server run on
the server machine, since they require access to the resource
(such as a database) that the server manages.
The user server and administration server may actually run in the
same process or be implemented by several processes.
</Para>
<Para>As an example, consider the DCE Security Service.
One part of the security service software is the login facility,
which sets up a user's security environment.
This is an example of a user client.
It communicates over the network
with the privilege server, which runs on the security
server machine.
The privilege server is an example of a user server.
An example of an administration client in the security service is the
<Command>rgy_edit</Command>
program, which administrators use to modify data in the security
database.
It communicates over the network
with the registry server, which runs on the security
server machine.
The registry server is an example of an administration server.
</Para>
<Para>The software for each of the DCE services, namely the directory
service, DTS, the security service,
and DFS, can all be
divided roughly into these four configuration components.
</Para>
<Para>DCE Threads and DCE RPC are separate configuration components.
They help to implement the communications between machines, so they must be
present on every DCE machine, whether the machine acts as a client
or a server.
</Para>
<Para>Section 2.3 describes how machines participating in a DCE environment
are configured by using various combinations of configuration
components.
Section 2.4 describes how DCE cells are configured by using various
combinations of DCE machines.

<Para>DCE machine configurations

<Sect2 Id="ITODCE.CONF.div.5">
<Title>DCE User Machine Configuration</Title>
<Para>An example of a DCE user machine is a user's workstation.
This machine acts as a client to any of the DCE
servers, but it does not act as a server itself (with one possible exception
noted in the next paragraph).
A DCE user machine contains DCE
Threads and DCE RPC software so it can communicate with other machines in the
DCE environment.
In addition, it contains the user client configuration components of
all the DCE services (see Figure 2-4).
Part of this software may be present in the form of libraries linked
with DCE application software.

<Para>A DCE administrator's workstation is configured with
the client sides of DCE administration programs to enable
the administrator to control servers remotely.
This configuration contains the administration
client software for each of the DCE services.
It also contains the DCE user software, since the administrator machines
act as user clients as well as administration clients (see Figure 2-5).

<Title>DCE Server Machine Configuration</Title>
<Para>Some machines in the DCE environment contain special-purpose server
software.
These are called <FirstTerm>DCE server machines</FirstTerm>.
</Para>
<Para>A DCE server machine is configured with the user server and
administration server components of a DCE service.
It also contains the DCE user software, since a server machine
can act as a client to other servers.
For example, a DTS server machine contains the DCE user
plus the DTS user server and DTS administration server
configuration components.
It is not necessary to run one server per machine; two or more
types of servers can run on a single machine.

machine and the configuration of a second
machine acting as both a CDS server and a security server.

</IndexTerm>An organization may wish its DCE cell to communicate
with other DCE cells, or with systems outside of DCE.
One way to accomplish this is through one of the global
directory services that DCE supports:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>DCE GDS, which is an
implementation of the X.500 directory service standard
provided as a DCE component
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>DNS, which is a global
directory service that DCE supports but does not
provide as a DCE component
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>A DCE cell is connected to a global directory service when
its name is registered in the global directory service's namespace.
The cell then establishes a trust relationship between its
authentication service and the authentication services of
cells that it wants to contact (this step is not necessary
for contacting systems without DCE security); this process
is called <FirstTerm>cross-cell authentication</FirstTerm>.  The trust relationship
established through cross-cell authentication gives DCE users
(and other principals) in the trusted foreign cell authenticated
access to resources in the local cell, and vice-versa.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 3>A cell's CDS communicates with CDS servers in foreign cells with
the help of an intermediary, GDA.
When a GDA machine is added to a DCE cell, the machines in
the cell will be able to contact DCE cells and other
systems by using X.500 or DNS.
Figure 2-10 shows the simple DCE cell with a GDA added to it.

<!-- .so intro/pic/2_config_10.pic-->
<?sml-space .5>
<Para>Another way to connect DCE cells is by establishing
a cell <Replaceable>hierarchy</Replaceable>.  A hierarchical cell configuration
consists of a <Replaceable>parent</Replaceable> cell, which is registered in one of
the global directory services, and one or more <FirstTerm>child</FirstTerm>
cells, which are registered in the parent cell's
CDS.  The GDA again acts as the intermediary
for cells in the hierarchy to contact each other,
but the child cells do not have to register with the global
directory service to communicate with each other.
A hierarchical cell configuration also provides for
more extensive, transitive trust
relationships between cells.  For more information about
hierarchical cells, see Chapter 3 of this manual.
</Para>
<Para>If a cell contains a global directory server, not only can
it access the X.500 namespace through the GDA, but it can
also own and administer a portion of that namespace in GDS.
For more information on GDS 
and CDS, see Chapter 3 of this manual.
