<Title>DCE Distributed Time Service</Title>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.1" Significance="Preferred">
<Primary>DTS</Primary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>A distributed computing
system has many advantages but also brings with it new
problems.
One of them is keeping the clocks on different nodes synchronized.
In a single system, there is one clock
that provides the time of day to all applications.
Computer hardware
clocks are not completely accurate, but there is always one consistent
idea of what time it is for all processes running on the system.
</Para>
<Para>In a
distributed system, however, each node has its own clock.
Even if it were possible to set all of the clocks in the distributed
system to one consistent time
at some point,
those clocks would drift away from that time at different rates.
As a result, the different nodes of a distributed system have
different ideas of what time
it is.  This is a problem, for example,
for distributed applications that care about
the ordering of events.
It is difficult to determine whether Event A on Node X occurred before
Event B on Node Y because
different nodes have different notions of the current time.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 9>DCE DTS addresses this problem in two ways:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>DTS
provides a way to periodically
synchronize the clocks on the different hosts in a
distributed system.
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.2">
<Primary>time</Primary>
<Secondary>synchronization</Secondary>
</IndexTerm></Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>DTS also provides a way of keeping that synchronized
notion of time reasonably close to the
<Replaceable>correct</Replaceable>
time.
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.3">
<Primary>time</Primary>
<Secondary>correctness</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>(In DTS, correct time is
considered to be
UTC, an international
standard.)
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.4">

</IndexTerm>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.5">

</IndexTerm>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.6">
<Primary>standards</Primary>
<Secondary>and DTS</Secondary>
</IndexTerm></Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>These services
together allow cooperating nodes to have the same notion of
what time it is, and to also have that time be meaningful in the rest of the
world.
</Para>
<Para>Distributed time is inherently more complex than
time originating from a single source since clocks cannot be continuously
synchronizing, there is always some discrepancy in their ideas
of the current time as they drift between synchronizations.  In
addition, indeterminacy is introduced in the communications
necessary for synchronization since clocks synchronize by sending messages
about the time back and forth, but that message passing itself takes a
certain (unpredictable) amount of time.  So in addition to being able to
express the time of day, a distributed notion of time must also include
an
<Replaceable>inaccuracy</Replaceable>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.7">
<Primary>inaccuracy</Primary>
<Secondary>time</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>factor; that is, how close the timestamp is to the real time.
As a result, keeping time in a distributed environment requires not only
new synchronization
mechanisms, but also a new form of expression of time&mdash;one
that includes the
inaccuracy of the given time.
In DTS, distributed time is therefore expressed
as a range, or interval, rather than as a single point.

<Para>Time-Provider Interface (TPI)
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Time format, which includes inaccuracy
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>The active components are the time clerk and different kinds of
time servers.
There are two interfaces: a programming interface (DTS API) and an interface
(TPI) to an external time-provider.
Finally, DTS defines a new format for expressing time.
</Para>
<Sect3 Id="ITODCE.T3I.div.3">
<Title>Time Clerk</Title>
<Para>The time clerk is the client side of DTS.
It runs on a client machine, such as a workstation, and keeps the
machine's local time synchronized by asking time servers for the
correct time and adjusting the local time accordingly.
</Para>
<Para>The time clerk
is configured to know
the limit of the local system's hardware clock.
When enough
time has passed that the system's time is above a certain inaccuracy
threshold (that is, the clock may have drifted far enough away from
the correct
time), the time clerk issues a
<FirstTerm>synchronization</FirstTerm>.
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.9">
<Primary>time</Primary>
<Secondary>synchronization</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>It queries
various time servers for their opinion of the correct time of day,
calculates the probable correct time and its inaccuracy based on the
answers it receives, and updates the local system's time.
</Para>
<Para>The update can be gradual or abrupt.  If an abrupt
update is made, the software register holding the current time is
modified to reflect the new time.  Usually, however, it is desirable to
update the clock gradually and, in this case, the
tick
increment is
modified until the correct time is reached.  In other words, if a clock
is normally incremented 10 milliseconds at each clock interrupt, and the
clock is behind, then the clock register will instead be incremented 11
milliseconds at each clock tick until it catches up.
</Para>
<Para>Figure 3-16 shows a LAN with two time clerks (C) and three time servers
(S).
Each of the time clerks queries two of the time servers when
synchronizing.
The time servers all query each other.

<Sect3 Id="ITODCE.T3I.div.4">
<Title>Time Servers</Title>
<Para>A time server
is a node that is designated to answer queries about the
time.
The number of time servers in a DCE cell is configurable;
three per
LAN is a typical number.
time clerks query these time servers for the time, and the time servers query
one another, computing the new system time and adjusting their own
clocks as appropriate.  One or more of the time servers can be attached to an
external time-provider (described later in this section).
</Para>
<Para>A distinction is made between
local time servers
(time servers on a given LAN) and
global time servers.
This is because they are located differently by their clients.
A client may need to contact a global time server if, for
example, the client wants to get time from three servers, but only two servers
are available on the LAN.  In addition, it may be desirable to configure
a DTS system to have two LAN servers and one global time server synchronizing
with each other, rather than just having time servers within the LAN
synchronizing with each other.  This is where
couriers
are needed.
</Para>
<Para>A courier time server
is a time server that synchronizes with a global time
server; that is, a time server outside the courier's LAN.  It thus
imports
an outside time to the LAN by synchronizing with the outside
time server.  Other time servers in the LAN can be designated as
backup courier time servers.
If the courier is not available, then one of the
backup couriers serves in its place.
</Para>
<Para>Figure 3-17 shows two LANs (LAN A and LAN B) and their time servers (S).
In each LAN, one of the time servers acts as a courier time server (Co)
by
querying a global time server (G) (that is, a time server outside of either
LAN) for the current time.

<Title>DTS Application Programming Interface</Title>
<Para>DTS provides an API library that allows programmers to manipulate
timestamps.
For example, programmers can obtain a timestamp representing the
current time, translate timestamps to different formats, and compare
two timestamps.
</Para>
</Sect3>
<Sect3 Id="ITODCE.T3I.div.6">
<Title>Time-Provider Interface</Title>
<Para>So far, all the components described are those supporting the
synchronization of a distributed system's clocks.  There must also be a
way to ensure they are synchronized to the
<Replaceable>correct</Replaceable>
time.  The notion
of the correct time must come from an outside source, which is the
external time-provider.
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.10">
<Primary>external time-provider</Primary>
</IndexTerm>This may be a hardware device such as one that receives time
from radio or telephone sources.  This external time is given to a time
server, which then communicates it to other servers.  Such an external
time-provider can be very accurate.  If no such device is available, the
external time source can be the system administrator, who consults a
trustworthy time source and enters it into the system.  This
cannot, of course, be as accurate as an automatic time source, but it
may be sufficient in some cases.
</Para>
<Para>DTS supports the ability to interface with an external time-provider
through the
time-provider interface.
The external time-provider itself, however, is a hardware device (or
a person), and is therefore outside the scope of DCE.

<Para>The

used in DTS is a standard one: UTC, which notes
the time since October 15, 1582, the beginning of the Gregorian calendar.
This time is interpreted using
the Time Differential Factor (TDF) for use in different time zones.

<Primary>DTS</Primary>
<Secondary>end user's perspective</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>From a user's point of view, the advantage of having a distributed
time service is
that more applications work as expected
in a distributed environment.  For
example, the UNIX
<Command>make</Command>
program compiles new binary files if it
discovers that the source file has been changed since the last time the
binary was compiled.  In a distributed system, this may not work
properly if the source is on one machine and the binary is on another,
and the two machines have different ideas of what time it is (and of
what time it was when their files were updated).  Having DTS means that
the nodes have roughly the same notion of time, and the
<Command>make</Command>
program works as expected.
</Para>
</Sect2>
<Sect2 Id="ITODCE.T3I.div.9">
<Title>Programming with DTS</Title>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.15">
<Primary>DTS</Primary>
<Secondary>programming with</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>There are two ways a programmer can be affected by the presence of DTS
in a system.
It is possible for an application to retrieve
the time from the system in the same way as before DTS was introduced.
But with DTS, the
system's time is more correct and is synchronized with
other nodes' clocks in the distributed system.
</Para>
<Para>It is also possible for the programmer to
use the DTS API to
directly deal with distributed time.  Since DTS time is represented
differently than single-node time&mdash;it includes inaccuracy&mdash;new
routines are provided for comparing times and for converting from DTS
time format to the native system's time format.
The API also includes routines for retrieving the current time,
performing calculations on times, and handling time zone information.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 12>If programmers choose to use DTS directly, they must handle a new
contingency when comparing times.
When asking the question ``Which time is earlier, Time A
or Time B?'' it is possible to get the answer ``We do not know.''
When the two time intervals overlap, there is no way of determining
which occurred first.
Programmers can handle this in two ways:
they can ignore the inaccuracy and compare the two median times,
or (the safer alternative) they can acknowledge that either time
could have been first and take the more conservative action.
For example, if it cannot be determined when running the
<Command>make</Command>
program, whether the source or the executable was modified last,
the compilation can be rerun just in case the source was modified
after the executable was generated.
</Para>

<Title>DTS Administration</Title>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3I.indx.16">
<Primary>DTS</Primary>
<Secondary>administration</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>Administering a distributed time service is more involved than
administering the time in a single node.
In a single node, time administration
typically consists of setting the time and date when a
system is first started up and then updating the time occasionally to
compensate for clock drift.
</Para>
<Para>DTS requires more set-up and configuration work for the administrator,
although, once it is up and running, the administrative maintenance tasks
are infrequent.
