<Title>DCE Threads</Title>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3B.indx.1" Significance="Preferred">
<Primary>Threads</Primary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>In a traditional computer program, there is only one thread of control.
Execution of the program proceeds sequentially, and, at any given
time, there is only one point in the program that is currently
executing.
It is sometimes useful, however, to write a program that contains
multiple threads of control.
For example, some programs lend themselves to being structured as
multiple flows of control, some programs show better performance
when they are multithreaded, and multiple threads can be mapped to
multiple processors when they are available.
</Para>
<Para>A distributed computing environment based on the client/server model
and remote procedure call can make good use of the capability for
multiple threads of control.
For example,
when a client makes an RPC call, it blocks until a response is returned
from the server.
If there are multiple threads of control in the client, then work can
continue in another thread while the thread waiting for the RPC response
is blocked.
On the server side, this same situation applies since a server may itself
issue an RPC.
In addition, servers often handle the requests of multiple clients.
It is sometimes easier to write a well-structured program when
each request can be handled by a separate thread of control.
Often servers manage information, requiring input/output operations
to a storage device.
While one server thread is waiting for its input or output operation
to finish, another server thread can continue working, improving overall
performance.
</Para>
<Para>Using multiple threads puts new requirements on programmers:
they must manage the threads, synchronize threads' access to global
resources, and make choices about thread scheduling and priorities.
A threads implementation must provide facilities for programmers to
perform these tasks.
</Para>
<Para>Threads can be provided by a programming language, an operating system
kernel, or a user-space library.
DCE Threads is provided as a user-space library; this has
implications for its interaction with other software on the system,
such as an operating system that delivers signals to or blocks a whole
process, rather than just
a thread, and preexisting library calls that were not originally
written for
a multithreaded environment.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 5>The following subsections give an overview of the DCE Threads technology
component.
They describe the different kinds of functions provided by the technology
and how DCE Threads is seen from the end user's, programmer's, and
administrator's perspective, focusing particularly on programming with
DCE Threads since the application programmer is the main consumer of this
technology.
</Para>
<Sect2 Id="ITODCE.T3B.div.2">
<Title>What is DCE Threads?</Title>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3B.indx.2">
<Primary>standards</Primary>
<Secondary>and Threads</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>DCE Threads is a user-level (nonkernel) threads library
based on the pthreads interface specified by POSIX in the 1003.4a
standard (Draft 4).
It consists of an API that gives programmers the ability
to create and manipulate threads, as described in
Section 3.1.3.
The other technology components of
OSF DCE assume the availability of
threads support.  DCE Threads is provided for use on operating
systems that do not provide threads already; if a threads package is
already available, then DCE Threads may not be needed.
DCE Threads can be used as is&mdash;as a user-level threading
facility&mdash;or it can be mapped to an existing threads facility provided
by the host operating system.
</Para>
<Para>DCE Threads is designed for compatibility with existing
operating systems that deal with processes rather than threads, and libraries
that are not reentrant (that is, not written to handle multiple threads
executing within them at the same time).
This compatibility is provided through the use of ``jacket''
routines, which are used in conjunction with existing libraries, and
modified operating system calls.
Since messages from the outside world (such as interrupts and signals)
have traditionally been addressed to a process, rather than a specific
thread in a process, this interaction must be modified as well.
For further information on the way DCE Threads interacts
with other software, see the chapters on threads in the
&DCEDg;.

<Para>An end user is not aware whether or not threads are being used
in an application,
except for a possible difference in performance.
An application written with threads may run faster than a
single-threaded version of the same application.
<!-- .ig ++-->

<Secondary>programming with</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>The distributed application programmer can use threads to help
structure a program.
However,
having multiple threads of control can introduce a higher level of
complexity than programming with a single thread of control.
Threads must be managed, scheduled, and allowed to communicate with
one another in a controlled manner.

<Secondary>management</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>In a traditional process, there is only one thread of control, and it is
started and terminated implicitly.  However, when it is possible to have
more than one thread of control, the threads must be created and destroyed
explicitly.  DCE Threads provides the facilities for doing this.
</Para>

<Title>Threads Scheduling</Title>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3B.indx.6">
<Primary>Threads</Primary>
<Secondary>scheduling</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>In the traditional process model, no scheduling is needed since there is
only one thread of control, and, whenever the process runs, that thread
runs.  However, with multiple threads, if there are fewer available
processors than the number of threads to be run, some decision must be
made as to which thread runs first.  This is analogous to the
scheduling of processes by the operating system on a timesharing system,
except that the threads
scheduling is visible to and controllable by the application
programmer.
(Note that POSIX specifies that scheduling
is optional, so systems using their own threads implementations
may not include the functionality provided by DCE Threads that is
described in this section.)
</Para>
<Para>DCE Threads scheduling is built on two basic, interacting
mechanisms:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Scheduling priorities
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Scheduling policies
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>Each thread has a scheduling priority associated with it.
Threads with a higher priority have precedence over threads
with a lower priority when scheduling decisions are made.
The exact treatment of threads of different priorities depends on
the scheduling policy under which they are running.
</Para>
<Para>DCE Threads offers three scheduling policies:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>First-In, First-Out (FIFO)
</Para>
<Para>The thread in the highest priority category
that has been waiting the longest to run is scheduled first.
It runs until it blocks, then again the thread that has been waiting the
longest runs, and so on.
Threads in the highest priority level are run in this first-in, first-out
manner, then the threads in the next highest priority level are
run FIFO, and so on.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Round-Robin (RR)
</Para>
<Para>All of the threads at the highest priority
level are given turns running by timeslicing.
That is, one thread runs for a period of time, then it is interrupted
and another thread runs for a period of time, and so on, until
all threads have had a chance.
The process is repeated until all threads in that priority are finished
or blocked.
Then the threads in the next highest priority level are also run
RR until they are all finished or blocked, and so on.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Default
</Para>
<Para>Each thread is given turns running by <FirstTerm>timeslicing</FirstTerm>.
Higher priority threads are given longer periods of time
to run, but even the lowest priority
thread eventually has a chance to run.
This is in contrast to FIFO and RR scheduling,
in which it is possible for higher priority threads to
prevent lower priority threads from running at all.
</Para>

<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3B.indx.8">

</IndexTerm>
<Para>Threads communicate through shared variables; that is, one
thread sets a variable that another thread later reads.
However, if multiple threads are accessing the
same variable, incorrect results can occur due to scheduling of threads
and race conditions.
To resolve this problem, access to shared variables must be
synchronized.  DCE Threads provides three facilities for synchronizing
threads within a process:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Mutual exclusion objects (mutexes)
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Condition variables
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>The
<Command>join</Command>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3B.indx.9">
<Primary><Command>join</Command> routine</Primary>
</IndexTerm>routine
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>The
<FirstTerm>mutex</FirstTerm>
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3B.indx.10">
<Primary><FirstTerm>mutex</FirstTerm> object</Primary>
</IndexTerm>object is used to synchronize
access to a given resource, such as a shared variable,
by multiple threads.  Mutexes ensure that only one
thread accesses the resource associated with the mutex
at a time, thus the name <Replaceable>mutual exclusion</Replaceable>
or <FirstTerm>mutex</FirstTerm>.
</Para>
<Para>The mutex works as follows.
One mutex object is associated with each shared resource;
for example, a shared variable.
Before reading or writing the variable, a thread attempts
to
<Replaceable>lock</Replaceable>
the variable's mutex.
If it succeeds in locking the mutex, the thread proceeds
to access the variable, and then it
<Replaceable>unlocks</Replaceable>
the mutex.
</Para>
<Para>If a second thread tries to access the object while the
first thread is accessing it (the condition that can cause
indeterminate results if the shared variable is not protected),
the second thread is blocked when it tries to lock the mutex.
When the first thread finishes with the variable and unlocks
the mutex, the second thread is unblocked and gains the lock
for the
mutex.
It can then proceed to access the shared variable.
</Para>
<Para>The mutex is a facility by which threads can ensure that their
access to shared resources is synchronized.
The threads may or may not be communicating through the shared data.
The second method of thread synchronization, the
<Replaceable>condition variable</Replaceable>,
<IndexTerm Id="ITODCE.T3B.indx.11">
<Primary>condition variable</Primary>
</IndexTerm>is used for explicit communications among threads.
This is done through the use of a shared resource&mdash;the condition
variable&mdash;and as a result requires the use of a mutex.
</Para>
<Para>For example, using a condition variable, Thread A can
wait for Thread B to accomplish some task.
To do this, Thread A
<Replaceable>waits</Replaceable>
on the condition variable until Thread B
<FirstTerm>signals</FirstTerm>
the condition variable, indicating that the particular task has been
accomplished.
</Para>
<Para>Note that, although the condition variable is used for explicit
communications among threads, the communications are anonymous.
For example, Thread B does not necessarily know that
Thread A is waiting on
the condition variable that Thread B signals,
and Thread A does not know that it was Thread B that woke it
up from its wait on the condition variable.
</Para>
<Para>There is another synchronization method that is not anonymous&mdash;the
<Command>join</Command>
routine.  This allows a thread to wait for another, specific
thread to complete its execution.
When the second thread has finished, the first thread unblocks
and continues its execution.
Unlike mutexes and condition variables, the
<Command>join</Command>
routine is not
associated with any particular shared data.

</IndexTerm>
<Para>DCE Threads provides two ways to obtain information about the 
results of a threads call.
One way, specified by the POSIX P1003.4a
(pthreads) draft standard, is that status values are returned to the thread.
DCE Threads also gives the programmer an alternative to
status values.
This is provided by the exception-returning interface, which is an
extension to the basic POSIX functionality.
Exceptions enable routines to ignore status returns when other parts of
the program are handling errors.

<!-- .ig ++-->
<!-- .H 3 "Example Use of Threads"-->

<!-- .P-->
<!-- How would a programmer use threads in writing a typical distributed-->
<!-- application?  One example is when writing the server part of a-->
<!-- client/server application.  A server typically executes a-->
<!-- continuous cycle:-->
<!-- first it waits for a request to arrive,-->
<!-- then it processes the request,-->
<!-- then it sends back a reply, and starts over again waiting for the next-->
<!-- request.  This can be inefficient, since the server may spend-->
<!-- some of its request-filling time in idle\*(EMwaiting for I/O to complete,-->
<!-- for example.  So often a server process can be made more efficient by-->
<!-- designing it to run with multiple threads.  One initial thread might-->
<!-- wait for a request, and when it receives one, create a new thread to-->
<!-- handle it, while itself going back to listen for the next request.-->
<!-- Alternatively, a pool of threads might be created when a server starts-->
<!-- up, and the threads can take turns servicing incoming requests.-->
<!-- .P-->
<!-- Threads may need to share access to global variables, in which case-->
<!-- the programmer can make use of the synchronization routines.  For-->
<!-- example, the server might need to keep track of the total number of-->
<!-- requests it processes.-->
<!-- A programmer could implement this by having different threads update a-->
<!-- global counting variable; for example, a variable called-->
<!-- \*Ltotal\*O.-->
<!-- In this case, a thread must first make sure-->
<!-- another thread is not accessing the variable at the time it wishes to-->
<!-- update it.  It does this by claiming the variable's mutual exclusion lock,-->
<!-- called, for example,-->
<!-- \*Lmutex_total\*O.-->
<!-- Then the thread can update the global variable.-->
<!-- The thread then unlocks the mutex, and other threads are free to-->
<!-- access the variable.-->
