<Title>Explanation: </Title>
<para>If returned by the <Function>pthread_cond_destroy</Function> routine, an attempt was
made to delete a condition variable for a thread that was executing a
<Function>pthread_cond_timewait()</Function> routine or a <Function>pthread_cond_wait()</Function>
routine.</para>
<para>
If returned by the <Function>pthread_mutex_destroy</Function> routine, an attempt was
made to delete a mutex that is locked (has a current owner).</para></MsgExplan>
<!-- -->
<MsgExplan>
<Title>Action: </Title>
<para>If you still wish to delete the condition variable, wait until the
<Function>pthread_cond_timewait()</Function> or <Function>pthread_cond_wait()</Function> routines
complete and try again.</para>
<para>
A locked mutex is owned by the thread that calls it using the
<Function>pthread_mutex_lock</Function> routine. It remains locked until the same
thread unlocks it. If no threads are waiting for the mutex, it can be
unlocked by using the <Function>pthread_mutex_unlock</Function> routine. It can then
be deleted.</para></MsgExplan>
