</IndexTerm>This chapter gives a conceptual overview of the DCE Distributed Time Service 
(DTS).  Some basic time and clock concepts, DTS time
representation, and basic DTS operation are also presented.
</Para>
<Para>DTS is a software-based service that provides precise,
fault-tolerant clock synchronization for systems in local area networks 
(LANs) and wide area networks (WANs).  The clock synchronization 
that is provided by DTS enables distributed computing applications to
determine event sequencing, duration, and scheduling.
</Para>
<Para>DTS consists of software components on a group of cooperating systems; it
conforms to the client/server model that is used in DCE.  In the DTS
implementation, each server supplies the
time to many client systems and applications through intermediaries called
<Replaceable>clerks</Replaceable>.  Clerks reside on their client systems.  (Note that,
throughout this part of this guide,
the term <Symbol Role="Variable">entity</Symbol> is used to refer to either the server process
or the clerk process when they have the same functions.) 
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 7>Most DCE nodes have a DTS clerk that adjusts the clock on its client system;
clerks use remote procedure calls (RPCs) to obtain time values from one or
several servers in the network.  The nodes that do not have DTS clerks have DTS
servers; in addition to providing time values to clerks, servers also adjust
the system clocks on their host systems.  Servers are also able to obtain
reference time values from sources of standardized time that are outside 
of the network. 
</Para>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="AGCC.DTSINT.indx.6">
<Primary>interval</Primary>
</IndexTerm>Because no device can measure the exact time at a particular instant,
DTS expresses the time as an interval
that contains the correct time.  In the DTS model, clerks
obtain time intervals from several servers and compute the intersection
where the intervals overlap.  Clerks then adjust the system clocks of their
client systems to the midpoint of the computed intersection.  When clerks
receive a time interval that does not intersect with the majority, the
clerks declare the nonintersecting value to be faulty.  Clerks ignore faulty
values when computing new times, thereby ensuring that defective server
clocks do not affect clients.
</Para>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="AGCC.DTSINT.indx.7">
<Primary>time</Primary>
<Secondary>standards</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>DTS also permits the importation of time values from outside sources, such as
the U.S.  National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST).  DTS uses the
UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) standard that has largely replaced Greenwich
Mean Time (GMT) as a reference.  Many standards bodies disseminate UTC by
radio, telephone, and satellite; commercial devices (time-providers) are
available to receive and interpret these signals.  DTS offers a
Time-Provider Interface (TPI) that describes how a time-provider process can
pass UTC time values to a DTS server and propagate them in the network.  The
TPI also permits other distributed time services to interoperate with DTS.
</Para>
<Para>DTS provides many other valuable services for computer
networks that run distributed applications.  The major features
and benefits of DTS are the following:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Correctness&mdash;DTS maximizes the probability that a
client will receive the correct time.  DTS uses UTC
as a base reference and defines any time interval
containing UTC as correct.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Quantitative Time Measurement&mdash;DTS uses specific
measurement and manufacturer's specifications to determine the quality of
the times that are reported by servers.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<?sml-need 2>
<Para RevisionFlag="Changed">Fault Tolerance&mdash;DTS reports faulty servers and does
not use their time values during clock synchronizations.

<Title>Applications Support</Title>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="AGCC.DTSINT.indx.10">
<Primary>applications</Primary>
<Secondary>using DTS</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>Operating systems and distributed applications require synchronized time
measurements to coordinate their processes.  DTS
synchronizes the system clocks in a network with each other and, in the
presence of an external time-provider, to the UTC time standard.  Any
distributed application that reads the system clock, which is the majority of
applications, needs DTS.  As the number of distributed
applications and systems in a network increases, DTS
becomes increasingly vital to process coordination.
</Para>
<Para>There are several types of existing applications that use the synchronized
time DTS provides to system clocks.  These applications
must reference synchronized system clocks in order to coordinate the events
that occur throughout the network.  Applications use synchronized clocks for
the following functions:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Event Measurement&mdash;Applications can read the system clock to start and
stop timers and to measure the elapsed time between events.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Event Reporting&mdash;Applications can read the clock when an event occurs
and append a timestamp to the event report.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Event Scheduling&mdash;Applications can read the system clock and add a
relative time to determine the occurrence of a future event.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Event Sequencing&mdash;Applications can determine the order of events by
reading the event report timestamps that are 
derived from the synchronized system clock.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>For new applications, DTS provides an API.  This
API provides routines that new applications
can use to obtain and manipulate binary timestamps.  The 
DTS API supports ANSI C language constructs.  (See the
&DCEDk; for further information on the
DTS API.)
</Para>
</Sect2>
<Sect2 Id="AGCC.DTSINT.div.4">
<Title>External Time-Provider Support</Title>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="AGCC.DTSINT.indx.11">
<Primary>time-provider</Primary>
<Secondary>support</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>For most networks, it is desirable to synchronize the system clocks with the
UTC time standard.  Many commercial devices are available for obtaining the
UTC time that is 
provided by standards organizations; these devices receive signals by
short-wave radio, satellite, and telephone.  If your network or cell is larger
than a single LAN, it is recommended that you use at least one external
time-provider in combination with the DTS software.  (See 
Appendix C for a list
of suppliers of time-provider hardware.  Sample time-provider programs are
available online in <Symbol Role="Variable">dcelocal</Symbol><Filename>/usr/examples/dts</Filename>.)
</Para>
<Para>DTS servers can synchronize with time-providers by means
of the TPI, which is described in the 
&DCEDk;.  The TPI specifies the 
communications between the DTS server process and the time-provider process.
</Para>
<Para>When a DTS server attempts to synchronize, it uses the TPI
to check for a time-provider process.  If one is available, the server
synchronizes only with the time-provider.  If no time-provider is present, the
server synchronizes with other servers in the network.

increase over time; the rate of change of error is known as <Replaceable>drift</Replaceable>.  If
each system clock in a network started at the same time and ran at the same

at a different rate, however, the system clocks throughout a network become

a specified maximum drift of a few seconds per day.  If uncorrected for
several days, the skew between networked system clocks can inhibit the
performance of distributed applications.
</Para>
<Para>The DTS server or clerk on each node tracks the drift of its client's system
clock and periodically synchronizes with other DTS nodes to reduce the skew
between its client's time value and those of the other DTS nodes.  The DTS

<Title>Communications and Processing Uncertainties</Title>
<Para>Communications delays also inhibit the synchronization process, especially
when two systems communicate over a WAN or low-speed link.  DTS can adjust
for the known processing delays that are required to
send and receive messages between systems.  Due to the varying quality of
communications links, however, the time that is required to send, receive, and
acknowledge messages varies from one message to the next.  These delays cannot
be known exactly because transit over the network and the time required to
read an incoming timestamp both vary.
</Para>
<Para>Rather than using estimates of communications and processing delays,
DTS records all known error factors that accompany a time

</IndexTerm>In order to synchronize system clocks to the most accurate settings,
DTS needs a way to determine the accuracy of time sources
relative to each other and to UTC.  This section describes how 
DTS determines the relative accuracy of any time source
that is available in the network.
</Para>
<Para>DTS uses an inaccuracy value, or tolerance, to
determine the relative precision of time values that it obtains from system
clocks and external time-providers.  This DTS feature
effectively transforms each time value into an interval, or range, rather
than a point on a continuum.

<ListItem>
<Para>Drift&mdash;When reading a clock, DTS calculates
the amount of time that the clock may have drifted since 
DTS previously read the clock.  Drift is the largest
component of most inaccuracy values.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Communications Delay&mdash;The inaccuracy also contains the uncertain
portions of the communications delays between systems.  Although 
DTS compensates for processing delays, it cannot predict
or directly measure the varying delays that occur on network links.  The
inaccuracy values that a clerk or server obtains from co-located systems on a
LAN tend to be much lower than those obtained from servers outside the LAN.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Leap Seconds&mdash;UTC time is measured by atomic clocks, which are
extremely stable.  The standard, however, keeps time based on the earth's
position.  Due to the slowing of the earth's rotation, it occasionally
becomes necessary to advance UTC time by 1 second.  These events are known
as <Replaceable>leap seconds</Replaceable>.  Leap seconds may occur in the final second of
any month, and normally occur about once every 18 months.  At the end of each
month, DTS accounts for leap seconds by increasing all
inaccuracy measurements by 1 second.  DTS later adjusts
the clocks to remove the extra second of inaccuracy if an external
time-provider determines that a leap second did not actually occur.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>Without DTS to correct it, a system clock's inaccuracy is
always increasing.  For example, suppose that a clock starts with a UTC time
of 0:00:00.00 (midnight) and zero inaccuracy.  Due to drift, when the clock
next shows a time of 0:00:00.00, the inaccuracy is 8 seconds.  UTC time may
be 23:59:52.00 or 0:00:08.00, but is probably somewhere in between.
Therefore, the system time is an interval that contains 
UTC time and is bounded by the inaccuracy, as shown in 
Figure 23-1.  Using the
DTS format for displaying time, the combined time and
inaccuracy interval is expressed as follows:

</IndexTerm>To maintain uniform system times, DTS servers and clerks
periodically synchronize the clocks in all network systems.  The
DTS entity that is on each system performs these synchronizations
by requesting that servers send their combined clock and inaccuracy values 
(time intervals) to the originating system.  The entity then uses the values
that are sent by the servers to compute a new system time.
</Para>
<Para>DTS servers and clerks have slightly different
synchronization procedures.  Before attempting to synchronize with other
systems, DTS servers always check that an external
time-provider is present on the server system.  A given server requests times
from other servers if no time-provider is available.  When no time-provider
is available and a server synchronizes with its peer servers, the server
uses its own system time as one of the input values when it computes a new
system time.
</Para>
<Para>Most network systems run the DTS clerk process.  Clerks
cannot have time-providers, and they do not use the system time of their
client systems to compute new times.  When a clerk is synchronizing its
client system's clock, the clerk uses only the time values that it obtains
from servers to compute a new system time.
</Para>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="AGCC.DTSINT.indx.26">
<Primary>computed time</Primary>
</IndexTerm>When a DTS clerk requests time intervals from
several servers, it uses them to calculate a new 
time that is correct (that is, contains UTC) 
and that minimizes inaccuracy.  When the servers respond and the 
DTS clerk calculates network communications
uncertainties and drift for each of the time values, the clerk has a
set of intervals (<Literal>t1</Literal> through <Literal>t4</Literal> in Figure 23-2).  Since each
interval contains UTC, the intersection is the smallest interval the clerk
can choose that also contains UTC.  This intersection is the 
computed time.  The DTS entity uses the computed
time interval to adjust the clock on the system that receives the server
values.
</Para>
<Para>In addition to eliminating large inaccuracy values during synchronization,
DTS also discards intervals that are received from faulty clocks 
(<Literal>t2</Literal> in the figure).  DTS detects and rejects
clock intervals that do not intersect with the majority of the
intervals.  When DTS detects a faulty interval, it notifies the system
manager by displaying an event message, identifying the server that sent the
faulty value.
</Para>
<Para>A server that has a high-drift clock or is far away in the network submits its
time to the DTS entity (<Literal>t1</Literal> in the figure), but the large time
interval is ignored since more accurate times are available.  Note that, in 
Figure 23-2, the endpoints of correct time (<Literal>t1</Literal>) are further from the
computed time midpoint than those of the interval that 
is declared faulty (<Literal>t2</Literal>).

<Para>During the synchronization process, servers with the greatest accuracy have
the most influence in determining new system times throughout the
network.  In the previous figure, the server that submitted time value
<Literal>t3</Literal> has
the smallest correct interval and is therefore the closest to the computed
time.  Server systems with external time-providers are usually the servers
with the most accurate times.  Beyond TP servers, those servers with the
highest quality clocks and best communications links tend to influence the
time on other systems to the greatest degree.
</Para>

</IndexTerm>The synchronization process also reduces the skew between systems.  The
computed time interval is often smaller than the interval that is
supplied by any single clock.  Note that the 
computed time in the previous figure is a
smaller interval than any of the source intervals.  As the synchronization
procedure is constantly repeated on each network system, the skew between
systems is reduced and they are more closely synchronized.  However, if a
time-provider is absent from the network, the clocks may collectively drift
away from UTC.

sends interrupts to the operating system at fixed intervals; each interrupt is
a single tick.  A software register that contains the current value of the
time is incremented by a fixed amount (for example, 10 milliseconds) at each
tick.  DTS adjusts the rate of the clock by changing only the incremental value
that is added to the software register.  It does not directly affect the ticks
of the hardware clock.
</Para>
<Para>DTS adjusts system clocks at the rate of 100 to 1; that is, it
requires 100 time units to adjust 1 time unit of error.  For example, it
takes 1 minute and 40 seconds to correct a 1-second error.  This rate of
adjustment exceeds the normal rate of drift so that synchronization is
carried out without further significant interference from the clock.

other servers that have the same epoch number.  All servers have the same
epoch number when they are created.  Infrequently, you may wish to change a
server's epoch number, using the management interface, to isolate it from
the network in order to correct a problem.

<Title>The Local Server Set</Title>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="AGCC.DTSINT.indx.48">
<Primary>local</Primary>
<Secondary>servers</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>Local servers reside on the same LAN and maintain their clocks
by synchronizing with each other.  Due to the high throughput on this type of
network, the skews between the local servers on a LAN are normally maintained
at under 200 milliseconds.  If at least one of the servers in the local set
synchronizes with an accurate time-provider, inaccuracies at each
server may be less.
</Para>
<Para>When a server is first initialized, it exports its binding to its entry in the
namespace and adds its name entry to the LAN profile.  Every server is
automatically entered in the LAN profile for the related portion of the
network.  Local servers also import bindings from the LAN profile to build
lists of servers with which they can synchronize.
</Para>
<Para><?sml-need 7>Local servers perform time interval computations, adjust their clocks, and
provide time values to each other for synchronization purposes.  Each server
attempts to synchronize with every other server in the local set at periodic
intervals.  At longer intervals, clerks request time values from the local
servers.  Clerks, however, need only to request intervals from the number of
servers determined by the <Literal>minservers</Literal> attribute, which is usually a
subset of all the local servers.
</Para>

<Sect3 Id="AGCC.DTSINT.div.21">
<Title>The Global Server Set</Title>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="AGCC.DTSINT.indx.49">
<Primary>global servers</Primary>
</IndexTerm>Local servers are available only to the servers and clerks that
are in a single LAN, but global servers are available throughout a cell.  Any
server can be configured as either a local or a global server (See the DCE
control program <Command>dts configure</Command> command).  The number of
global servers is usually small, but global servers have several important
functions that enable DTS to synchronize every node in the network.  Global
servers are necessary in the following situations:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>When a network has multiple LANs or an extended LAN
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>When systems that are not on LANs have access to LANs through
point-to-point links
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>When clerks or local servers cannot access the required number of local
servers determined by the <Literal>minservers</Literal> attribute
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>You can reconfigure a local server as a global
server by using the <Command>dcecp</Command> <Command>dts configure</Command> command
with the <Option>global</Option> option.  Configuring a server as a global server
causes the server to export its binding to its entry in the namespace
and its name to the cell profile.
</Para>
<Para>Local servers and clerks request time values from global servers when they
cannot obtain the number of local server responses that are mandated by the
<Literal>minservers</Literal> attribute.  Certain local servers also regularly request
the time from global servers.  See the following
subsection.

<Title>Couriers</Title>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="AGCC.DTSINT.indx.50">
<Primary>couriers</Primary>
<Secondary>about</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>Local servers called <Replaceable>couriers</Replaceable> request time values from one randomly
selected global server at every synchronization.  When DTS starts up,
it automatically sets the server's <Literal>courierrole</Literal> attribute value to
<Literal>backup</Literal>.  You can change the server's courier role by manually changing
this attribute value.  To do this, you use the <Command>dcecp</Command> <Command>dts modify</Command> 
command with the <Option>change</Option> option.  If a server is connected to an 
external time-provider, you want to reconfigure it as a courier.
</Para>
<Para>Couriers maintain lists of global servers whose bindings they import from the
cell profile.  At every synchronization, couriers use the responses of all
local servers and one global server when synchronizing their own
clocks.  Couriers provide network-wide synchronization through the following
procedure:
</Para>
<OrderedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Couriers request time values from at least one global server in a remote
area and request the balance of values from local servers up to the number
determined by the <Literal>minservers</Literal> attribute.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Couriers use the global server times and local server times to
synchronize the clocks that are in their respective systems.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Couriers relay newly computed clock times to other servers and clerks on
the LAN during future synchronizations.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</OrderedList>
<Para>For a network containing multiple LANs or point-to-point links, one server
on each LAN or segment needs to be configured as a courier.  This configuration
ensures that various portions of the network remain synchronized and are not
isolated from each other.
</Para>
<Para>Using the management interface, you can also designate one or more servers to
be backup couriers.  These local servers temporarily assume courier
functions in the event that no courier servers are available on the LAN.  In
such a case, the backup courier with the lowest ordered Universal Unique
Identifier (UUID) regularly synchronizes with global servers until a courier is
again available.
</Para>
<Para>If a courier cannot find any global server, then it uses local
servers and increments its <Literal>no global server detected</Literal> count.
