<title>Introduction to the DCE Directory Service</title>
<!-- - -->
<!-- --><para>Distributed processing involves the interaction of multiple
systems to do work that is done on one system in a traditional computing environment.
 One  challenge resulting from this network-wide working environment is the
need  for a universally consistent way to identify and locate people and resources
 anywhere in the network. </para>
<para>The DCE Directory Service makes it possible to contact people and to
use resources such as disks, print queues, and servers anywhere in the network
without knowing their physical location.  The  directory service is much like
a telephone directory assistance service  that provides a phone number when
given a person's name.  Given the unique name of a person, server, or resource,
it can return the network address and other information associated with that
name.</para>
<para>The DCE Directory Service stores addresses and other relevant information
as <replaceable>attributes</replaceable> of the name.  For example, attributes
can  contain the name of an organizational unit, such as European Sales; a
location, such as the first floor of Building A; or a telephone number.  Users
can search for a name by supplying one or more of its attributes.  For example,
given the search  criteria of <literal>John Smith</literal> and <literal>
Chicago</literal>, the directory service could  produce a list of telephone
numbers for users in Chicago named John Smith. </para>
<note><para>Search capabilities are currently limited to  the global part
of the DCE Directory Service environment.</para>

The DCE Directory Service is a fundamental service that applications can rely
on and use to their advantage.  This section describes how other DCE components
use the DCE Directory Service.</para>
<para>The DCE remote procedure call (RPC) interface facilitates the development
and use of distributed applications that follow a client/server model.  In
the RPC model, <replaceable>clients</replaceable> are programs that make remote
procedure calls, and <replaceable>servers</replaceable> are programs that
carry out the procedures.  The DCE RPC software stores information in the
directory service about the addresses of RPC servers and the interfaces they
support.</para>
<para>When an RPC client wants to make a call to a particular server, it can
query the directory service for the information necessary to contact that
server.  If the client wants to access a specific resource that is named in
the directory service, it can query for that specific name.  If a client application
 knows the type of service that it wants,  such as C compilers, printers,
or employee information, but does not know the address of a specific server,
 it can also use the directory service to find that information. <indexterm

authentication servers.</para>

Distributed File Service (DFS) provides a location service for filesets (logical
groups of files) so that users can access remote files as if they are on the
local system.  DFS uses the DCE Directory Service to find  out how to contact
its fileset location servers.</para>

Distributed Time Service (DTS) is responsible for synchronizing system clocks
in the network.  Synchronized clocks are important to any distributed application
that needs to keep track of the order in which events occur across multiple
systems.  DTS uses the DCE Directory Service to find out how  to locate its
time servers. <!-- --><!-- --><!-- - --></para>

<title>How to Use DCE Directory Services</title>

<!-- --><indexterm id="AGCC.CDSOV.indx.9"><primary>directory service</primary>
<secondary>how used</secondary></indexterm><para>Other than DCE administrators,
the people who use directory services normally do so indirectly, through an
application interface.  An application can interact with the directory service
on behalf of users who create a name for a resource and subsequently refer
to it by that name.  The following examples, both real and hypothetical, explain
some of the ways that users can use the directory service:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>A user invokes a spell-checking application on a new document.
 The application contains DCE RPC client code on the user's local system.
The RPC client contacts the directory service for information on an available
spell-checking server.  The directory service returns the address of the server,
the protocol type it uses to communicate, and a universal unique identifier
(UUID) that represents an interface.  Using this information, the RPC client
makes a remote call to the server and the server checks the spelling in the
user's document.  The user is unaware that use of the spell checker involved
a call to the directory service and interaction with a remote server.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>A user logging into a system enters a name and password. 
The directory service helps the login program locate an authentication server,
which verifies  the user's identity in an authentication database.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>A user enters a file specification.  The directory service
provides the address of a DFS fileset location database, which contains the
network address of a server that allows the user to access the file.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>A user enters the name of a computer conference or electronic
bulletin board and the directory service provides an address, allowing the
application to connect to the conference service.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>By entering a name or some information about a printer's capabilities,
a user can learn the printer's network address.  For example, the user may
want to find the address of the closest and fastest available color printer.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>A user needs information from an employee in the marketing
department.  The user remembers that the employee's last name is Wong, but
cannot remember the first name.  By entering the last name and department
name in an employee locator application, the user can check the directory
service for information on all Wongs in the marketing department and find
out how to contact the employee.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>A user enters a report in a problem-tracking database.  Although
the database was recently moved to a new node, the user is not aware of the
change because the database is always referred to by its name only.  The directory
service stores the current network address and provides it to the problem-tracking
application and any other application that requests it.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<indexterm spanend="AGCC.CDSOV.indx.9" id="AGCC.CDSOV.indx.10"><para>The remainder
of this chapter explains how the DCE Directory Service environment works with
regard to cells. It introduces the main directory service components: the

 GDS is an implementation of a directory service standard known as X.500.
 This standard is specified by the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) 9594 and the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee
(CCITT) X.500 series.  Because it is based on a worldwide standard, GDS offers
the opportunity for a universally interoperable global directory.</para>
<para>Figure 11-1 represents a hypothetical configuration of two cells that
each use GDS to access names in the other cell.  Names that are stored directly
in GDS also are accessible from each cell.  CDS is the directory service within
each cell.  The same organization administers both cells, which are configured
based on geographic location and network topology.</para>

</indexterm>DNS is a widely used existing global name service for which DCE
offers support. Many networks currently use DNS primarily as a name service
for Internet host names. Although DNS is not a part of the DCE technology
offering, the  directory service contains support for cells to interoperate
through DNS. <indexterm id="AGCC.CDSOV.indx.19"><primary>Global Directory

<para>The GDA is the DCE component that makes cell interoperation possible.
The GDA enables CDS to access a name in another cell through one of the global
naming environments (GDS or DNS), or through the CDS of the parent cell, if
the cell is part of a hierarchical cell configuration. The GDA is an independent
process that can exist on a system separate from a CDS server, although by
default the DCE configuration script configures the GDA on the same machine
as a CDS server. CDS needs to be able to contact at least one GDA to participate
in the global naming environment.</para>
<para><?sml-need 10>Figure 11-2 shows how the GDA helps CDS access names outside
of a cell.  When CDS determines that a name is not in its own cell, it passes
the name to a GDA, which searches the appropriate naming environment (CDS,
GDS, or DNS) for more information about the name. <!-- --><!-- -->The GDA
returns information that enables the original CDS server to contact the CDS
server in whose cell the name resides. The GDA can help CDS find names in
a cell that is registered in DNS (Scenario A), a cell that is registered in
GDS (Scenario B), or a cell that is registered in the originating cell's parent
cell (not shown). <!-- --><!-- -->The GDA decides which name service to use
based on the syntax of  the name.  Section 11.5 describes name syntaxes in
detail.</para>

DNS or GDS global directory services), the DCE administrator must obtain a
unique cell name from either of the global naming environments, depending

<para>The shaded boxes in the DIT represent the entries that are named in
the column labeled relative distinguished name.  The schema dictates that
countries are named directly below the root, followed by organizations, organization
units, and names of users.  Each attribute value that makes up an RDN (and
thus a distinguished name) is called a <indexterm id="AGCC.CDSOV.indx.58">
<primary>distinguished value</primary></indexterm><replaceable>distinguished
value</replaceable>.</para>
<para>As the rightmost column in the figure illustrates, the distinguished
name of the entry at each level of the DIT is a concatenation of RDNs from
the root of the global directory to that entry's level.  The lowest entry
in the hierarchy, <filename>/.../C=US/O=ABC/OU=Sales/CN=Smith</filename>,
represents the name of a user, John Smith, who works in the sales division
of ABC Company, an organization in the United States.  The abbreviated attribute
type labels stand for Country (<literal>C</literal>), Organization (<literal>
O</literal>), Organization Unit (<literal>OU</literal>), and Common Name (<literal>
CN</literal>).</para>
<para>Note that the figure shows the global DCE convention for distinguished
names.  Each distinguished name starts with the representation of the global
root (<filename>/...</filename>). Attribute types and values are separated
by equal signs, and RDNs are separated by slashes. <!-- --><!-- --><indexterm

by all X.500 implementations. In addition, these conventions are only used
at the GDS adminstration interface level. Internally, distinguished names
are specified in other ways. <!-- --><!-- --></para>

structure of GDS names points out another important difference  between GDS
and CDS.  A CDS name is distinct from its attributes;  that is, it consists
of a string of directory names ending with the  simple name of the entry.
 In contrast, a GDS name consists solely of a series of attribute types and
their values.</para>
<para><indexterm id="AGCC.CDSOV.indx.63"><primary>full names</primary></indexterm>Figure
11-5 illustrates this difference in the construction  of CDS and GDS names.
 The CDS full name  <filename>/.:/Admin/Personnel/Employee_DB</filename> is
the complete directory specification of an entry with the simple name <literal>
Employee_DB</literal>.   Attributes and their values are not a part of the
CDS full name.   The GDS distinguished name <filename>/.../C=US/O=ABC/OU=Sales
</filename> is a  concatenation of attribute types and values, one from each
level of a DIT schema.</para>

supports the ability to search for names by supplying the values of one or

time consuming, so GDS allows users to restrict the scope of a search.  Support

about</secondary></indexterm><para>The DCE naming environment supports the
version of DNS that is based on Internet Request for Comments (RFC) 1034 and
RFC 1035.  Many networks currently use DNS primarily as a name service for
host names.  The most commonly used implementation of DNS is the Berkeley
Internet Naming Domain (BIND).  The BIND namespace is a hierarchical tree
with its topmost levels under the control of the Network Information Center
(NIC).  (See <!-- --><!-- the \*EPlanning, Configuring, and Starting Up DCE\*O
module of this guide--><!-- -->the &DCEAi; for information on how to contact
the NIC Domain Registrar to register a domain name.)</para>
<para><indexterm id="AGCC.CDSOV.indx.67"><primary>BIND namespace</primary>
<secondary>structure</secondary></indexterm>The names directly under the root
of the BIND namespace  include 2-letter codes for countries, such as  <literal>
us</literal> and <literal>gb</literal>, as defined in ISO Standard 3166, ``Codes
for the Representation of Names  of Countries.'' Other names one level below
the root include several generic administrative  categories, such as <literal>
com</literal> (commercial), <literal>edu</literal> (educational),  <literal>
gov</literal> (government), and <command>org</command> (other organizations).
  The owners of these names can grant permission to companies and organizations
to create new subordinate names.  Figure 11-6 shows a sample portion of the
BIND namespace.  (The double quotes indicate that the root of the namespace
has a null name and is not addressable.)  Note that,  like CDS names, DNS
names are not typed; that is, they do not consist of pairs of attribute types
and values.</para>

<?sml-space .5>
<para><?sml-need 6>A DNS name consists of a string of hierarchical names 
that are separated by <literal>.</literal> (dots) and arranged right to left

Institute of Technology artificial intelligence  department.  Note that the
order of elements in the name is the reverse of the order for CDS and GDS
names.</para>
<para>To use a DNS cell name as part of a global DCE name, specify the DNS
name intact between two slashes.  For example, a cell whose DNS name is <filename>
ai.mit.edu</filename> might contain a directory whose CDS name is <filename>
/.:/profiles</filename>.  Users should enter <filename>/.../ai.mit.edu/profiles

in the DCE Directory Service.  Some services connect into the cell namespace
by means of specialized CDS entries called <replaceable>junctions</replaceable>.
 A junction entry contains binding information that enables a client to connect
to a server outside of the directory service.</para>
<para>For example, the security service keeps a database of principals (users
and  servers) and information about them, such as their passwords.  The default
name of the security service junction is <filename>/.:/sec</filename>.</para>
<para>The following example illustrates the parts of a global DCE principal
 name:</para>
<graphic entityref="AGCC.CDSOV.ent.8" Scalefit="1" Reprowid="200" Reprodep="200"></graphic>
<para>The cell name, <filename>/.../C=US/O=ABC/OU=west</filename>, is a GDS
name.  The <literal>sec</literal> portion is the junction entry in CDS, and <literal>
principals/mozart</literal> is  a principal name that is stored in the security
service database.</para>
<para><?sml-need 4>Another service that uses junctions is DFS.  The DFS fileset
location service  <indexterm id="AGCC.CDSOV.indx.71"><primary>global names
</primary><secondary>outside directory service</secondary></indexterm>keeps
a database that  maps DFS filesets to the servers where they reside.  The
junction to this database has a default name of <filename>/.:/fs</filename>.
 The following example illustrates the parts of a global DCE filename:</para>
<graphic entityref="AGCC.CDSOV.ent.9" Scalefit="1" Reprowid="150" Reprodep="150"></graphic>
<para>The global name contains a DNS cell name, <filename>/.../ai.mit.edu
</filename>.  The  <literal>fs</literal> portion is the file system junction
entry in CDS, and  <filename>/users/mozart/myfile</filename> is the name of
a file.</para>
<para>Thus, the DCE namespace is a connected tree of many kinds of names from
many different sources.  The GDA component of the directory service provides
connections out of the cell and to other cells through a global namespace,
such as GDS or DNS. In a similar manner, junctions enable connections downward
from the cell namespace to other services. <!-- --><!-- --><!-- --><!-- -
