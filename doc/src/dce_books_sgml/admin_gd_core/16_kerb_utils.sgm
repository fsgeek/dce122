<Title>Kerberos Interoperability with DCE and Secure Remote Utilities </Title>
<?og-ChangeStart enh,13624,R1.2.2,New chapter on kerb 5 interop">
<Para>The authentication portion of the DCE Security Service is primarily
based on Version 5 of the Kerberos network authentication system, which
is described in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC 1510.  
For the most part, this basis has allowed the
DCE Security Server to operate as a Kerberos Key Distribution Center
(KDC) for Kerberos V5 clients.  In prior releases of DCE (Versions
1.2.1 and earlier), this interoperability was not officially supported or
documented. 
</Para>
<Para>This chapter explains interoperability features and configuration of DCE 
and Kerberos V5.  The following main features are provided with the current 
release of DCE:

</ItemizedList>
<Para>When a client uses a secure remote Kerberos V5 utility such as 
<Command>rsh</Command> or <Command>rlogin</Command> to
connect to the server daemon, the server
daemon requests authentication. The remote utilities authenticate
the identity of the client and server to each other
in a secure way. The secure remote utilities also authorize users
to access an account on a remote system. This is done through
the transmission of encrypted tickets rather than through the traditional 
password mechanism. The
traditional password mechanism, used with nonsecure remote utilities,
sends the password in a readable form (unencrypted) over the network. This
creates a security risk from intruders who may be listening over the network.
The main benefit of running the secure remote utilities is that
user authorization no longer requires transmitting a password in a readable
form over the network.
</Para>
<Para>For the secure <Command>rlogin</Command> utility and <Literal>rlogind</Literal> server, Kerberos V5
authentication involves sending encrypted tickets instead of a readable
password over the network to verify and identify the user. 
The secure <Command>rsh</Command> utility, when used with a command, and the <Command>rshd</Command> 
server ensure that the user is authorized
to access the remote account. If <Command>rsh</Command> is used without a specified command,
<Command>rlogin</Command> and <Literal>rlogind</Literal> are invoked.
</Para>
<Para>If any secure remote utility is installed in an environment in which some
of the remote systems are not secure, the clients will try accessing 
those remote systems without using Kerberos authentication.
</Para>
<Sect2 Id="AGCC.SECKU.div.3">
<Title>Related Kerberos Terms and Concepts</Title>
<Para>Although realms, cells, principals, and authorization are discussed in the
Authentication chapter of the <Symbol Role="Variable">OSF DCE Application Development Guide</Symbol>, 
they are described here briefly
as they relate to the secure remote utilities.
</Para>
<Sect3 Id="AGCC.SECKU.div.4">
<Title>Realms and Cells</Title>
<Para>In Kerberos, a realm defines an administrative boundary and has a unique name. 
A realm consists of the KDC and all the security clients (application servers 
and application clients) registered to that KDC.
</Para>
<Para>When using the DCE Security Server as a KDC, the term cell is used.
A cell is roughly equivalent to a realm.
</Para>
<Para>By convention, Kerberos uses uppercase realm names, which appear as
suffixes in principal names such as <Literal>david@MYREALM.COM</Literal>.
</Para>
<Para>A DCE cell name must be lowercase and have a prefix of
leading <Filename>/.../</Filename> in a principal name, such 
as <Filename>/.../my_kdc_cell.com/david</Filename>.
</Para>
</Sect3>
<Sect3 Id="AGCC.SECKU.div.5">
<Title>Principals</Title>
<Para>Each principal that participates in Kerberos V5
authentication and authorization must be in the KDC
database, which is the security registry database for DCE. 
The KDC database does not distinguish between types of principal
names. However, distinguishing between two kinds of principal names 
&mdash; 
user principal names and service principal names &mdash; is useful.
</Para>
<Para>A user principal name is associated with a specific user of the secure
remote utilities. 
A user principal name consists of a user ID and a realm (or cell) name.
Each user must have a user principal name in the KDC database. An
example of a Kerberos user principal name is <Literal>susan@MYREALM.COM</Literal>. An
example of a DCE user principal name is
<Filename>/.../my_kdc_cell/susan</Filename>.
</Para>
<Para>A service principal name is one that authorizes a client to use a
particular service, including the specific application server machine that the 
service will access, and the realm name.
For <Command>rlogin</Command> and <Command>rsh</Command>, the service principal name is <Command>host</Command>.
An example of a Kerberos service principal name for <Command>rlogin</Command> is
<Literal>host/abc_system.com@REALM_A.COM</Literal>.
An example of a DCE service principal name for rlogin is
<Filename>/.../cell_a.com/host/abc_system.com</Filename>.
</Para>
</Sect3>
<Sect3 Id="AGCC.SECKU.div.6">
<Title>Authorization</Title>
<Para>Kerberos V5 authorization is the process by which users verify that they may 
access remote accounts on specified servers. Authorization depends on 
successful
user principal validation through the Kerberos V5 authentication protocol.
</Para>
<Para>For Kerberos V5 authorization to succeed, a mapping must exist on the 
application server that authorizes the user principal to operate as the 
login user. The term login user refers to the user whose account is being accessed on the remote
host. This is not necessarily the same user who originally issued 
the <Command>kinit</Command> or <Literal>dce_login</Literal> command.
</Para>
<Para>Assume David has already issued the <Command>kinit</Command> command. In this example,
David enters the following command, in which Susan is the login user:
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing>$ <Literal>rlogin -l susan hostA</Literal>
</ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
<Para>Authorization is successful if both of the following requirements are met:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>The login user must have an entry in the <Filename>/etc/passwd</Filename> file on the 
application server (remote host).
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>One of the following conditions must be true:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>A <Filename>$HOME/.k5login</Filename> file must exist in the login user's home directory on
the application server and contain an entry for the authenticated user
principal. This file must be owned by the login user, and only the login user
can have write permission.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>A Kerberos V5 authorization name database file called <Filename>/krb5/aname</Filename> must 
exist on the
application server and contain a mapping of the user principal to the login
user. This condition requires additional tools only available in a full 
Kerberos environment.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>The user name in the user principal must be the same as the login user name,
and the client and server systems must be in the same realm.

<IndexTerm Id="AGCC.SECKU.indx.6">
<Primary>Key Distribution Center</Primary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>The security server, which is the trusted host to which security clients 
authenticate themselves, is referred to as the Key Distribution Center
(KDC). The DCE Security Service fulfills the role of the KDC.
</Para>
<Para>Security clients are hosts that run the secure remote utility clients and
daemons. Security clients communicate
with the security server for authentication. The two types of security
clients are application clients and application servers.
</Para>
<Para>Application clients can run the secure remote utilities <Literal>rcp</Literal>, <Command>rlogin</Command>, 
and <Command>rsh</Command>.
The Kerberos utilities <Command>kinit</Command>, <Command>klist</Command>, and <Command>kdestroy</Command>
also run on the application client. In some cases, an application client 
is referred to as a local host.
</Para>
<Para>Application servers can run the secure remote utility daemons <Literal>rlogind</Literal> and
<Command>rshd</Command>. In some cases, an application server is
referred to as a remote host.
</Para>
<Para>The secure remote utility takes the following steps to be authenticated by the 
KDC:
</Para>
<OrderedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>The user first issues the <Command>kinit</Command> or <Literal>dce_login</Literal> 
command to the KDC and obtains a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) from 
the authentication server (AS) portion of the KDC.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>When the user invokes one of the secure remote utilities,
the client requests a service
ticket from the ticket granting server (TGS) portion of the KDC. As part of
the request, the client sends to the TGS the acquired TGT,
the name of the application server (remote host), and an encrypted
authenticator. 
</Para>
<Para>The same TGT can be used to acquire multiple service tickets.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>The TGS generates new credentials that both the server and client 
use to authenticate each other. Included in the TGS credentials is a subsession
key, which is a new key that is an encrypted form of the old session key
that the client sent to the TGS. Also, the TGS sends the requested service
ticket to the client. This ticket holds a copy of the subsession key and
an encrypted form of the target server's secret key.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>The client sends to the application server the service ticket
and a new authenticator that is encrypted with the subsession key. 
The application
server decrypts the service ticket with its own secret key and extracts the
subsession key. This subsession key is now a <Symbol Role="Variable">shared secret</Symbol> between the
client and the application server.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>At the client's request, the application server can also return
to the client credentials encrypted in the subsession key. This implies
a mutual authentication between the client and the application server. This
optional Kerberos V5 mutual authentication step is performed in each of the
secure remote utilities.
</Para>
</ListItem>

<Sect2 Id="AGCC.SECKU.div.8">
<Title>Forwarding Tickets</Title>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="AGCC.SECKU.indx.7">
<Primary>TGT</Primary>
<Secondary>forwarding</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>Service ticket credentials that a user obtains are for accessing a remote system.
What if, however, the user wants to use a secure service to access a remote
system and then run a secure service from that remote system to a second
remote system? This can be risky because it would require possession of a 
valid TGT for the first remote system. Therefore, running <Command>kinit</Command> on the 
first 
remote system to
obtain a TGT would cause the user's password to be transmitted in a
readable form over the network.
</Para>
<Para>To avoid this problem and provide more security, Kerberos offers the option to 
create TGTs that have special attributes allowing the TGTs to be forwarded to 
remote systems within the realm.
</Para>
<Para>The <Command>rlogin</Command> and <Command>rsh</Command> utilities offer TGT forwarding options
<Option>f</Option> and <Option>F</Option>. Before the forwarding options
can be recognized, two prerequisite flags must be enabled.
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>First, the KDC's forwardable ticket option must be enabled. 
For the DCE Security Server, use
the <Command>dcecp account modify</Command> command to set the <Literal>forwardabletkt</Literal> 
account attribute.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Second, <Command>kinit</Command> must be invoked with the forwardable flag (<Option>f</Option>) 
enabled. If the <Option>f</Option>
option is selected when <Command>kinit</Command> is run, the TGT for the local system can be
forwarded to the remote system and clients will not need to reauthenticate
themselves from the remote system to the KDC.
</Para>
<Para>DCE clients must use <Literal>kinit -f</Literal> to enable forwarding because the
<Literal>dce_login</Literal> utility does not have options for ticket attributes.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>Provided these two flags are enabled, the forwarding options of <Command>rlogin</Command> and
<Command>rsh</Command> can take effect. When the <Command>rlogin</Command> or <Command>rsh</Command>
client invokes the <Option>f</Option> option, forwarding of the TGT occurs to only 
one remote system (one free hop). When the <Command>rlogin</Command> or <Command>rsh</Command>
client invokes the <Option>F</Option> option, forwarding the TGT 
can continue to more than one
system (potentially unlimited free hops).
</Para>
<Para>Multiple free hops are possible because using the <Option>F</Option> option leaves the
forwardable attribute enabled in the forwarded TGT ticket, whereas using
the <Option>f</Option> option does not. Thus, the client can forward the TGT to an 
unlimited
number of remote systems if the <Option>F</Option> option is used every time. 
Once the <Option>f</Option>
option is used, the forwarding chain stops at the next node.
</Para>
<Para>If the Kerberos V5 credentials are forwarded to a
DCE client, they will be promoted to DCE credentials, allowing the user
to run DCE applications on that remote host.  The <Literal>k5dcelogin</Literal> utility, which is invoked by <Literal>rlogind</Literal> on the remote host, converts the Kerberos V5 credentials to DCE credentials without prompting for a password. See the <Literal>k5dcelogin</Literal> reference page for syntax information.

<Para>The credential cache and keytab file format that
DCE clients use can be set with the <Command>dcecp hostvar set</Command> command. 
The default
format for both files is Version 1. You may change this on a per-host
basis to allow Kerberos
V5 applications to run on your DCE client and to share
keytab and credential files.
</Para>
<Para>For example, use the following <Command>dcecp</Command> command to set the version number 
format of the Kerberos V5 credential cache file to 3:
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing>dcecp> <Literal>hostvar set -krbccachevno 3</Literal>
dcecp> 
</ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
<Para>To set the version number format of the Kerberos V5 keytab file to 2:
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing>dcecp> <Literal>hostvar set -krbktvno 2</Literal>
dcecp> 
</ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
<Para>To display the current settings:
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing>dcecp> <Literal>hostvar show -krbccachevno -krbktvno</Literal>
dcecp> 
</ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
<Para>See the <Command>dcecp</Command> reference page for more information.
For the changes to take effect, stop and restart the DCE daemons on the host.
