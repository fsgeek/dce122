</IndexTerm>
<IndexTerm Id="OSFAGI.CELL.indx.2">
<Primary>configuring DCE</Primary>
<Secondary>planning</Secondary>
</IndexTerm></Para>
<Para>The purpose of 
Chapters 2 through 5
is to assist you in planning for the installation,
configuration, and maintenance of DCE.  For detailed information about
installing the DCE source tape and building DCE, refer to the &DCERe;
and the &DCEPg;.
Part 2 of this guide 
describes the configuration process, including
installing executable files, setting up a DCE cell, and configuring
servers and clients.
</Para>
<Para>This chapter discusses how to establish a DCE cell name.  This chapter
also describes how the cell namespace is organized and provides guidelines
for maintaining security and replicating parts of the cell namespace.  The last
portion of this chapter discusses what you need to consider as you plan
for including DFS in your cell.
</Para>
<Para>You need to answer a number of questions when planning
for a distributed system. Your answers to these questions
determine the basic requirements of your user environment.
Keep in mind the following global considerations
as you plan for DCE:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>How much do you think your environment will grow in the next few years?
Do you anticipate rapid or relatively slow expansion of your network?
</Para>
<Para>If you think your environment will grow rapidly, consider setting up
several cells representing smaller units of your organization.
You can manage these smaller units as your network expands.
As explained in the &DCEIn;, members of each cell share
a common purpose, and the cell is a unit of administration and security.
If you anticipate slow expansion of your network,
you may be able to establish
one or more cells based on the organization that exists now.
Consider how many administrators you will need to maintain your DCE cell,
based on anticipated future growth.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>How much information does your environment have that needs to be
distributed?  How much do the users in your network share information?
</Para>
<Para>If there is a large volume of information that needs to be shared
within your network, consider the amount of disk space you require
and the number of DFS File Server machines you need.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>How much information updating do you require?  Do the users in your network
mainly look up information, or do they create and change information at their
workstations?
</Para>
<Para>If information changes frequently and users in your network depend on
the accuracy of that information, you need to consider how much you
rely on replication.
It is better to go to a central source of information for data that changes
frequently.
If users look up information but do not
need to change the information that is shared with other users, you can
rely more on replicated data.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Is the most important data the most available data?
Have you made plans to replicate this data?
</Para>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="OSFAGI.CELL.indx.3">
<Primary>replication</Primary>
<Secondary>cell configuration</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>CDS, GDS, the Security Service, and DFS maintain master copies of their
respective databases.
Each CDS directory can be replicated separately.  In addition to DFS
databases, individual DFS filesets or groups of filesets can be
replicated.  GDS replication, also known as shadowing, can be done for a
single object or an object and its subordinates (a subtree).
The Security Service replicates the entire registry database.
Because other components depend on the information managed by the
Security Service and parts of the CDS namespace, that data
needs to be available at all times.  For example, the special character
string <Filename>/.:</Filename> (the cell root) is stored in CDS and must always be available.
</Para>
<Para>Keep in mind that while replicating data improves availability,
there is a cost in terms of performance and the amount
of administration required.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<IndexTerm Id="OSFAGI.CELL.indx.4">
<Primary>gateways</Primary>
<Secondary>in cell configuration</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>
<Para>If your network has a gateway, are the servers located on the same side of
the gateway as the clients that rely on those servers?
</Para>
<Para>CDS servers broadcast messages at regular intervals
to advertise their existence to CDS clerks in the network.  Clerks learn
about servers by listening for these advertisements.
Placing the servers and the clients that rely on them on the same side of the
gateway facilitates efficient updates of information and a quick response
to client requests.  Additional administration is required if you rely
on servers that are not available through the advertisement protocol, which
is effective only in a local area network.
</Para>
<Para>Consider how fast and how expensive links are if you are administering
a cell that includes users in different geographic locations.  You may want to
keep more information locally to reduce your dependence on transmitting
information across links.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Is communication limited to your own cell, or do you need to
communicate with other cells?
</Para>

<IndexTerm Id="OSFAGI.CELL.indx.6">
<Primary>cells</Primary>
<Secondary>communication between</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>DCE offers two methods of connecting cells so that they can communicate:
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>The standard intercell connection, in which a cell is registered
in a global directory service that DCE supports
and communicates with other cells registered in that directory
service. A cell can be registered in both the GDS and DNS
directory services. In this case, the cell has two names:
one in GDS format, and one in DNS format. These names are
the cell's aliases.
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>The hierarchical cell connection, in which a cell is
registered in another cell's CDS namespace, and communicates
with other cells also registered in that cell's namespace.
In a hierarchical cell configuration, the cell at the
top of the hierarchy must be registered with a global
directory service, but the cells beneath it do not
need to be, because they communicate through CDS.
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>Regardless of which method you choose, in order
for your cell to communicate with other cells,
you must
</Para>
<ItemizedList>
<ListItem>
<Para>Establish a unique name for your cell and define
it in the appropriate namespace (GDS, DNS, or CDS)
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Have at least one GDA running in the cell
</Para>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
<Para>Establish a Security Service trust relationship with the
other cells with which you wish to communicate
</Para>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList>
<Para>
</Para>
<Sect1 Id="OSFAGI.CELL.div.2">
<Title>Establishing a Cell Name</Title>
<Para>
You must establish a name for your cell before
you configure it. A uniquely
identified cell name is critical to the operation of the Security
Service; this name is the basis for authentication in your cell.
Whether or not your cell name needs to be globally unique
depends on your plans for communication with other cells.
</Para>
<Para>If you plan to create a private cell and never intend
for it to communicate with cells outside your organization,
you are not required to obtain a globally unique cell name.
However, if you plan to communicate with the cells of
other organizations, you must obtain a globally unique
cell name for your cell before you configure it.
</Para>
<Para>If you plan to communicate with other cells through
GDS, DNS, or CDS, you must obtain a globally unique
name for your cell. The next sections describe how
to establish GDS, DNS, and hierarchical names
for your cell. See Appendix A of the &DCEAc; for a description
of the valid characters supported in GDS, DNS, and CDS.
</Para>
<Para>In some cases, you may need to change the name of your
cell after you have configured it, for example, because
your company has reorganized and the cell name
you established at configuration time no longer
reflects the new organization. In other cases,
you may need to add another name for your cell,
for example, if you initially registered it
in GDS and find that you must also register
it in DNS. To add a new name for your cell, use the
<Command>dcecp cellalias</Command> task object. 
</Para>
<Sect2 Id="OSFAGI.CELL.div.3">
<Title>Establishing a GDS Cell Name</Title>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="OSFAGI.CELL.indx.7">
<Primary>Global Directory Service (GDS)</Primary>
<Secondary>cell name conventions</Secondary>
</IndexTerm>If you plan to use GDS to communicate with other cells,
you must obtain a globally unique name for your cell
from the GDS global naming authorities before you configure
your cell, then define it in the GDS namespace. The name
you obtain for your cell will be in GDS syntax.
</Para>
<Para>As explained in the &DCEIn;, GDS-style names consist of
a series of attribute/value pairs, separated by equal signs
(=). Each attribute/value pair is called a relative
distinguished name (RDN). The directory information tree (DIT)
determines the hierarchy of a GDS name; that is, how the RDNs
are ordered to create a global name. An example of a GDS-style
global name, called a Distinguished Name (DN),
is <Literal>/.../C=US/O=ABC/OU=DCE/CN=gunther</Literal>.
Each RDN is separated by slashes (/). 
See the &DCEAx; for a complete description of the
GDS naming structure.
</Para>
<Para>DCE cell name values are generally stored in the Organization (<Literal>O=</Literal>)
or Organization Unit (<Literal>OU=</Literal>) attributes of a GDS name. For example,
the global name
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput><Literal>/.../C=US/O=ABC/OU=Seattle
</Literal></UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
<Para>uses the <Literal>OU=</Literal> attribute to store the cell name <Literal>Seattle</Literal>.
There is a fixed set of two-letter codes that must
be used to indicate the Country (<Literal>C=</Literal>) attribute
for your cell; for example, <Literal>C=US</Literal> or <Literal>C=JP</Literal>. The country
in which you reside may also have standard Organizations

<Title>Establishing a Hierarchical Cell Name</Title>
<Para><IndexTerm Id="OSFAGI.CELL.indx.12">
<Primary>hierarchical cell names</Primary>
</IndexTerm>Cells in a hierarchy use CDS to communicate. Consequently,
if you plan to add your cell to an existing cell hierarchy,
you establish a globally unique name for it by creating
a CDS name that represents your cell in the CDS namespace
of another cell, then appending this CDS name to the global
name of the cell in which you created your cell's CDS name.
(A cell's global name is its name starting from the <Filename>/...</Filename>
global root prefix.) The cell whose global name you use, and in
which you have created a CDS name for your cell, is known
as your parent cell, while your cell is known as a child cell.
For example, if your parent cell's global name is:
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput>/.../C=US/O=ZOMBIE/OU=WOOF
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
<Para>and the CDS name you created for your cell is <Literal>zappa</Literal>, the
name of your cell is:
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput>/.../C=US/O=ZOMBIE/OU=WOOF/zappa
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
<Para>Note that in this situation, the parent cell's global name
may contain CDS syntax as well as GDS or DNS syntax,
depending on where it exists in the hierarchy.
For example, your parent cell's global name could be
</Para>
<InformalExample>
<Para><ProgramListing><UserInput><Literal>/.../coolco.com/sales/northeast</Literal>
</UserInput></ProgramListing></Para>
</InformalExample>
<Para>where <Literal>/.../coolco.com</Literal> is the DNS namespace
portion of the name, in DNS syntax, and
<Literal>/sales/northeast</Literal> is the CDS namespace portion
of the name, in CDS syntax.
(Global names are also referred to as fully qualified
names. Both terms refer to names that begin at the global root
directory <Literal>...</Literal>.)
</Para>
<Para>Note that you currently cannot use the DCE configuration
program to configure a cell as a child cell for addition

<Para>Each of the DCE services maintains its own namespace within the

own namespace to ensure consistency among many files.
The Security Service maintains its own namespace to ensure that
the DCE cell remains secure.  Clients of these two services query CDS for
binding information that enables them to find Security or DFS servers.
The points where the binding information is stored serve as mount points
in the CDS namespace for the
namespaces that DFS and the Security Service manage.
This transition point between two namespaces

<Title>CDS Namespace Entries</Title>
<Para>The CDS namespace contains entries for servers, hosts, CDS clearinghouses
(collections of directory replicas stored at a particular server),
RPC profiles, RPC groups, and subsystems. The
entries have a CDS type of <Literal>directory</Literal> or <Replaceable>object</Replaceable>, indicating the
kind of CDS object to which the name refers.
A third CDS type, <Literal>softlink</Literal>, is an entry that points
to another entry.  A CDS directory is a container in
which objects are stored.  CDS uses directories to organize groups of
object entries.
</Para>
<Para>In addition,
the CDS namespace provides specialized services for other DCE components,
such as location information contained in the 
fileset location database (FLDB), which is the database
that maps filesets to the file server machines on which they reside.
</Para>
<Para>Profiles cataloged in the CDS namespace specify a search path through
the Directory Service.
The cell profile (<Filename>/.:/cell-profile</Filename>) stores the location of the 
servers that are available in the
cell, regardless of physical location.  In a geographically dispersed cell,
servers can be located in different cities or even different countries.
The LAN profile defines alternate servers that can be used in situations where
geographic proximity is important.
For example, <Filename>/.:/lan-profile</Filename> is the default
LAN profile used by DTS.  This profile contains entries for the DTS server
local set.  If a cell spans more than one LAN, another layer can be created
below <Filename>/.:/lan-profile</Filename> to specify the location of the profile for each
part of the cell.  For example, in a cell that encompasses two LANs, you
can direct hosts on one LAN to <Literal>lanA-profile</Literal> and hosts on the other
LAN to <Literal>lanB-profile</Literal>.  For information on setting up multiple
LAN profiles, see

domains simplifies the management of the cell filespace by creating smaller
units for administration.  All machines within an administrative domain
must be in the same cell.

<Para><IndexTerm Id="OSFAGI.CELL.indx.24">
<Primary>Distributed File Service (DFS)</Primary>
<Secondary>administrative lists</Secondary>
</IndexTerm><Replaceable>DFS administrative lists</Replaceable> are files that
define the principals and groups that can perform actions affecting specific 
server processes on a server machine.
There is one DFS administrative list for each 
DFS server process running on a machine.
For example, a server's <Literal>admin.bos</Literal>
file defines who has administrative rights to the BOS server
(<Command>bosserver</Command>), and thus
determines who can manipulate and maintain server processes on that one server.
Groups, as well as individual users, can be placed on an administrative list.
Each server machine stores administrative lists for its processes on its
local disk.  A process automatically creates its initial administrative list
when it is started if the list does not already exist on the local disk of
the machine.

</IndexTerm>
<Para>Follow the recommendations in the
the &DCEAd;
when you assign roles to the DFS machines in your cell.
</Para>
<Para>The first DFS machine that you configure during DCE installation and
configuration (described in Chapter 9) needs to function as a
<Replaceable>System Control Machine</Replaceable>.
The System Control Machine is the server that distributes DFS configuration
information.  Next you configure a <Replaceable>Fileset Location Database Server</Replaceable>, 
which is the server that maintains the fileset location
database.  The DCE installation and configuration script assumes that the
<Literal>root.dfs</Literal> fileset, which is the fileset that corresponds 
to the top (<Filename>/.:/fs</Filename>) level of the file tree, 
is located on the Fileset Location Database Server.
Section 2.4.5 and
<!-- section entitled ``Setting Up Filesets''-->
<!-- Chapter 52-->
<!-- Module 6 entitled ``DFS Configuration Issues''-->
the &DCEAd;
contain further information about <Literal>root.dfs</Literal>.
</Para>
<Para>Machines that you configure as DFS servers can run the processes required to
be DFS File Servers.
Be sure the machine you choose has enough space to store LFS filesets.
The amount of free space you need depends on how much data you plan to store
in LFS filesets.
Filesets on File Servers can store DFS client
binaries in addition to user files.
These filesets can also be distributed on other file server machines
in your cell.
In addition, if your domain has only one server machine, 
this machine must run all processes
and fill all required machine roles.  For example, in addition to being a
System Control Machine, this machine must be a File Server and a
Fileset Location Database Server.  If your domain has three or more 
DFS server machines, three machines need to store DFS databases.
An odd number of DFS database machines is recommended.

<!--  Module 6 entitled ``DFS Configuration Issues.''-->
the &DCEAd;, which

when using the <SystemItem Class="EnvironVar">@sys</SystemItem> and <SystemItem Class="EnvironVar">@host</SystemItem> variables in certain
pathnames.  When the DFS <Replaceable>Cache Manager</Replaceable> encounters one of these
variables, it substitutes a string that consists of the local machine's
architecture and operating system type for <SystemItem Class="EnvironVar">@sys</SystemItem> or the hostname
for <SystemItem Class="EnvironVar">@host</SystemItem>, causing a certain directory to be used.   
Using <SystemItem Class="EnvironVar">@sys</SystemItem> and <SystemItem Class="EnvironVar">@host</SystemItem> is helpful when
you are constructing symbolic links from the local disk to DFS.  
You can create identical symbolic links on all machines, 
but each machine transparently accesses the files
appropriate to its system name or hostname.  The DFS <Command>cm sysname</Command> command
sets and displays the current value for <SystemItem Class="EnvironVar">@sys</SystemItem>.
