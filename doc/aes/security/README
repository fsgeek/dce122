NOTE:
This Product Specification represents the support in DCE 1.1.
This specification will go through a company review then become
a CAE specification.
--------------------------------------------------------------

The following changes were made to the (Authentication and) Security
(Services) Specification for upgrading to the DCE 1.1 level:

--ACL

  Chapters 6, 7, 10 and 14 were updated to reflect the new ACL
  information, including algorithms, for delegation. These changes 
  are marked by the "|" changebar.

--Corrections

  Chapters 1,2,5,9,10,17 and 18 were updated to reflect corrections
  that are also pertinent to the 1.0 level of the specification.
  These changes are reflected by the "1" changebar, indicating they 
  are also appropriate for DCE 1.0.3.

--MD4

  Chapters 1,2,3 and 4 were updated to reflect the use of MD4 for 
  TGS requests. In particular, the MD4 checksum mechanism was added
  as a new section, 2.3, in chapter 2. These changes are reflected 
  by the "1" changebar, indicating they are also appropriate for 
  DCE 1.0.X.

-- sec_login API

  Chapter 18 was updated to include the sec_login routines for
  delegation.  These permit the enabling and disabling of delegation,
  and related functions. There are 9 routines in this new set.
  They are marked by the "|" changebar.  They are:
  
 sec_login_become_delegate()
 sec_login_become_initiator()
 sec_login_become_impersonator()
 sec_login_cred_get_delegate()
 sec_login_cred_get_initiator()
 sec_login_cred_init_cursor()
 sec_login_disable_delegation()
 sec_login_set_extended_attrs()
 sec_login_purge_context_exp()
 sec_login_tkt_request_options()

  The constants, codes, and other data types to reflect these
  new routines were also added as appropriate. (They are also
  marked by the "|" changebar.)

--EPAC Data Access
  Chapter 19 was added as a new chapter for the sec_cred API.
  It is marked by the "|" changebar. The sec_cred functions
  permit an abstraction of the extended attributes contained
  in the EPAC rather than providing direct access to them.
  There are 18 routines in this API. They are marked by
  the "|" changebar.

--rpriv RPC Interfac3

  Chapter 5 was updated for delegation to reflect new data types,
  the EPAC, sec_cred, and delegation tokens.

   It also reflects the addition of 3 new functions to the 
   rpriv RPC interface; 
        rpriv_become_delegate, 
        rpriv_become_impersonator, and 
        rpriv_get_eptgt.

 The delelegation changes are indicated by the "|" changebar.

--Unordered sets/paths 
  for Authentication

  Chapters 1 and 4 were updated to reflect that the sequence of
  authentication authorities is treated as an unordered set.
  These changes are marked by the "U" changebar.

--Introductory Material

  Chapter 1 is also updated to reflect discussions of the
  new sec_login, sec_cred, delegation, extended registry
  attributes and pre-authentication.  These changes
  are reflected by the "|" changebar.

--RPC Authorization Extension

  The replacement of rpc_binding_inq_auth_client() with the
  new rpc_binding_inq_auth_caller() to get a handle to the
  client's credentials has been noted. This mention is made
  in chapter 1, and marked with the "|" changebar. (Chapters
  18 and 19 reflect the use of the new function.)
  
--Registry API
  
  Chapters 10 and 15 have been updated to reflect the additions
  to the registry API for DCE 1.1.

--Appendixes

  Appendix A has been modified to account for the additions
  for the rpriv RPC interface, and to account for the Registry
  API routines, extended registry attributes and 
  pre-authentication.

  Appendix B is a new appendix that has been added to show
  the error codes that are possible.
