This DCE RPC CAE specification has been updated for all relevant changes
in DCE Version 1.1.  Updates are limited to those reflecting changes 
directly related to RPC.

All changes are marked with the | character in the right margin 
through use of the change-marker macro, .mc.  The .sp macro was also
used for correct positioning of the markers in PostScript output.

The following parts (files) of this document have been updated.  Details
are provided below.  In general, a number of implementation-related
passages were removed.
