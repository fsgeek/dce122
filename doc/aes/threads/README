The three postscript files in this directory are from the conversion 
of the existing specification, "AES/Distributed Computing - Threads",
which was in the OSF style to "DCE 1.1: Threads Specification" which
is in Open Group publications style.

Please note however that the "X/Open Company Limited" strings which
appear on the title part and the part separators are in the process
of being changed to "The Open Group." At the time of posting of
this specification, this work has not yet been accomplished, and
thus, this specification does not contain the new strings.

These are the files in this directory:

This specification reflects the current level of the Threads support
in DCE 1.1 (and 1.2) and is thus at that level.

NOTE:
This is an unpublished specification. It does not reflect the
latest threads standard (It is at draft level 4 of the standard).
