.H 3 "The Directory Service Interfaces"
.iX "-![" "XDS"
.iX "-: XDS" "XOM"
.P
The XDS and XOM APIs
provided by the DCE Directory Service are
based on X/Open specifications.
.iX "standards" "and XDS"
APIs are not really separate components (every DCE component includes
APIs to access it), but we call them out separately in this case because
programmers use the directory service APIs to access both DCE directory
services (CDS and GDS).
.H 4 "The XOM Application Programming Interface"
.P
XOM is an interface for creating, deleting, and accessing objects
containing information.
It is an object-oriented architecture in that each object belongs to a
particular
\*Eclass\*O,
and classes can be derived from other classes, inheriting the
characteristics of the original class.
The representation of the object is transparent to the programmer;
the object can only be manipulated through the XOM interface, not
directly.
XOM is used to create the objects that make up the directory service.
.P
XOM defines basic data types, such as Boolean, string, object, and so
on.
It defines an
\*Einformation architecture\*O,
.iX "information architecture"
including concepts such as objects, their attributes, and their classes.
It also provides definitions of routines for manipulating objects.
.H 4 "The XDS Interface"
.P
The XDS API is used by DCE programmers for accessing
information in the DCE Directory Service, whether the information is
managed by CDS or GDS.
It uses the XOM interface for defining and handling the information
objects that compose the directory.
These objects are passed as parameters and as return values to the
XDS routines.
The XDS API contains routines for managing connections with a directory
server; reading, comparing, adding, removing, and modifying entries;
listing directories; and searching for entries.
Some extensions to the X/Open standard that the DCE XDS API
provides include
provisions for security and cache management.
