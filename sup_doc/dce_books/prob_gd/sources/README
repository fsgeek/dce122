The files in this directory and its subdirectories are used to
to create "compiled" messages for the DCE components that cannot use the
sams tool.  For directions on processing the contents
of the directory, see the top level README for the OSF DCE Problem
Determination Guide.  The files contained here are as follows:


dfa/
   This directory contains the sams file for the DFA (Distributed
   File-Access) component. Note that, unlike the other components'
   sams files, the dfa.sams file is not actually used by DFA code,
   and no copy of the file exists in the DCE (code) source directory.
   At present (DCE 1.2.1) the only purpose of the dfa.sams file is to
   get the DFA messages properly into the Problem Determination Guide.

idl/

  This directory contains the source files (nidlmdg.m and nidlmsg.h) and
  the converter tool (idl_msg_converter) for creating the IDL .sams file.

idx/

    This directory contains the script (makeidx) for generating
    the two cross-references for the sams messages that appear in the PDG.
    It also contains the hand-created .idx files for the pthreads
    and XDS/XOM messages that feed into the indexes, because
    the sams tool cannot be used to create these files.

pthreads_add

    This file contains the pthreads messages that do not have message numbers
    or symbolic names.  Its contents should be copied to the beginning of
    the compiled message file after the sort.

pthreads_pdg/

    This directory contains the files for the individual pthreads messages.
    The files should be copied to the collection directory where you have
    placed the .sams files that are to be compiled for the other DCE
    components, before these files are sorted.

xds_pdg/

    This directory contains the files for the individual
    XDS/XOM messages.  The files should be copied to the collection
    directory where you have placed the .sams files that are to be
    compiled for the other DCE components, before these files are sorted.
