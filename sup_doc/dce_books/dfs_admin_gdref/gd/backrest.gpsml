.H 1 "Backing Up and Restoring Data"
.iX "Backup Database" "contents"
.P
Once the DFS Backup System is properly configured, it can be used to help
automate the process of making backup copies of both DCE LFS and non-LFS
filesets on tape.  These copies can then be used to restore data to the file
system in the event of data loss.  The Backup Database, which stores
information about the dump schedule for backups, the locations of the Backup
System's Tape Coordinators, the fileset families and their entries that can
be dumped, and other administrative information, can also be backed up to
tape and restored if the file system becomes damaged or corrupted.
.P
This chapter describes how to use the Backup System to list backup 
information, back up file system data, and restore data to the file system 
if necessary.  It also details the operations involved in administering the 
Backup Database, and describes canceling operations from the 
interactive interface.
.P
The operations in this chapter assume that the Tape Coordinator
machines are properly configured (including any special requirements
for stackers, jukeboxes, or other automated backup devices), the
fileset families and fileset entries are defined, the dump hierarchy
is defined, and the required tapes are labeled, as necessary.  Chapter
9 describes configuration of the Backup System in detail; make sure
the Backup System is properly configured according to the guidelines
detailed in Chapter 9 before attempting to use it to perform any of
the operations described in this chapter.
.H 2 "Introduction to the Backup Process"
.iX "-[" "Backup System" "how it works"
.P
Backing up, or dumping, data is the most basic operation performed with the
Backup System.  Data must be dumped to tape before it can be tracked in the
Backup Database and before it can be restored from tape to the file system.
This section provides an overview of the backup process.
.P
Dumping a fileset makes it inaccessible to other file system users for the
duration of the dump process.  To reduce inconvenience, create a backup version
of a fileset (a version with a \*L.backup\*O extension) and dump the backup
version rather than the read/write version; this does not interrupt a user's
work.  Creating a backup version of a fileset, using the \*Lfts clone\*O or
\*Lfts clonesys\*O command described in detail in Chapter 6, does make its
read/write source fileset unavailable for a short period of time; therefore,
you may wish to create backup versions during periods of low system usage,
using \*Lbos\*O commands to create a \*Lcron\*O process to automate the
procedure. (See Chapter 5 for a description of the \*Lbos\*O commands.)
.P
Occasionally, the Backup System cannot access a fileset, perhaps because of a
File Server machine or Fileset Server outage.  When this happens, it attempts
to access the fileset three times over the course of the operation.  If it still
cannot access the fileset after the third attempt, it omits the fileset from
the dump rather than aborting the dump or waiting for the fileset to become
accessible.  If the access failure occurs during a full dump, the next
incremental dump of the fileset includes the entire fileset; if the failure
occurs during an incremental dump, the next incremental dump of the fileset
includes all files modified since the last successful dump of the fileset.  You
can set the Tape Coordinator performing the dump to notify you of the omission
in its monitoring window (by specifying a value of \*L1\*O with the
\*L\-debuglevel\*O option of the \*Lbutc\*O command used to start the Tape
Coordinator).  The Tape Coordinator's error file also records the fileset's
omission.
.P
Following is a summary of the process the system uses to perform a typical
backup.  The example assumes that a backup is being performed on a Wednesday; 
the fileset family \*Lusersys\*O is to be dumped at the dump level whose name 
in the dump hierarchy is \*L/sunday/wednesday\*O in this example.  Note
that the Backup System makes no implied connection between the name of a
dump level and the date and time at which a dump at that level is to
occur; descriptive dump level names serve merely as reminders to system
administrators of when dumps are to be performed.
.ML
.LI
The Backup System reads the dump hierarchy in the Backup Database to see if
\*L/wednesday\*O is an incremental dump and, if so, to determine which
preceding level is its parent.  In this example, the \*L/wednesday\*O level is
incremental, and \*L/sunday\*O is its parent.
.oS
\*C/sunday\*O
\*C\ \ \ \ \ /monday\*O
\*C\ \ \ \ \ /tuesday\*O
\*C\ \ \ \ \ /wednesday\*O
\*C\ \ \ \ \ /thursday\*O
\*C\ \ \ \ \ /friday\*O
.oE
.P
If \*L/sunday\*O were specified, this would be a full dump; the system would
copy the complete contents of each fileset in \*Lusersys\*O.  Because
\*L/sunday/wednesday\*O is an incremental dump level, the dump set includes
only those files that changed since \*Lusersys\*O was dumped at the
\*L/sunday\*O level.
.LI
Because \*L/sunday\*O is the parent for \*L/wednesday\*O, the Backup System
checks the Backup Database for the date and time of the last dump of
\*Lusersys\*O at the \*Lsunday\*O level.
.LI
The Backup System reads the fileset family \*Lusersys\*O in the Backup Database
to learn which fileset family entries it contains.  The fileset family and its
entries were created beforehand with the \*Lbak addftfamily\*O and \*Lbak
addftentry\*O commands.  In this example, the entries are
.oS
\&.* .* user.*
\&.* .* sys.*
.oE
.P
.LI
The Backup System scans the FLDB to match the wildcards from each fileset
entry and generates a complete list of the filesets to be included in the
dump.  If duplicates are found, they are not dumped; only one occurrence of
any fileset is included.
.LI
The Backup System reads the label on the tape in the drive to verify that the
tape name is acceptable and that the tape does not contain an unexpired
expiration date.
.LI
The system transfers the list of filesets to be backed up to the appropriate
Fileset Server processes, which determine which data in the filesets was
modified after the date and time of the last dump at the \*L/sunday\*O level.
.LI
The designated Tape Coordinator puts the gathered data onto tape; the
expiration date and other information associated with the dump are stored in
the tape's label, and a unique dump ID number is assigned to the dump.
If one tape is not large enough to hold the entire dump set, the Backup System
prompts the operator to place additional tapes in the drive, as needed.
.LE
.iX "-]" "Backup System" "how it works"
.H 2 "Standard Information in this Chapter"
.P
The following subsections present standard options and arguments common to 
many of the commands described in this chapter.  They also present some 
common operations repeated throughout this chapter.
.H 3 "Standard Options and Arguments"
.P
The following options and arguments are used with many of the commands
described in this chapter.  If an option or argument is not described with a
command in the text, a description of it appears here. (See Part 2 of this
guide and reference for complete details about each command.)
.ML
.LI
The \*L\-family\*O \*Vfileset_family_name\*O option is the name of the
fileset family to be used in the command.  To make it easier to track the
contents of a fileset family, its name should give some indication of the
contents of the fileset entries it contains (for example,
\*Luser\*O for the fileset family that includes all user filesets in
the file system).
.LI
The \*L\-level\*O \*Vdump_level\*O option is the name of the dump
level to be used in the command.  The complete pathname of a dump level
must always be specified.  There are two types of dump levels: 
.ML
.LI
Full dumps, which consist of a name
preceded by a single / (slash); for example, \*L/full\*O.
.LI
Incremental dumps, which consist of multiple elements that resemble a 
pathname listing the dump levels that serve as the parents of the dump 
level, starting with a full dump level
and proceeding in order down the hierarchy; for example,
\*L/full/weekly/monday\*O.
.LE
.LI
The \*L\-tcid\*O \*Vtc_number\*O option is the TCID of the Tape Coordinator 
to be used for the command.  Legal values are integers from 0 (zero) to 1023. 
If this option is omitted, the Tape Coordinator with a TCID of 0 is 
used to execute the command by default.
.LE
.H 3 "Standard Commands and Operations"
.P
The following subsections describe commands and operations that are used 
frequently in this chapter.  If a command or operation is described in detail 
here, it generally is not described in depth in later sections of this 
chapter where it is used.
.H 4 "Starting a Tape Coordinator"
.iX "Tape Coordinators" "starting"
.P
Before performing a backup or restore operation, you must install at
least one tape drive on a Tape Coordinator machine and define the tape drive's
corresponding Tape Coordinator in both the
\*Vdcelocal\*L/var/dfs/backup/TapeConfig\*O file and the Backup
Database. If you are using automated backup equipment, you must also
create a user-defined configuration file. (See Chapter 9 for a
description of these and other configuration operations that must be
performed.) 
.P
This section explains how to start a Tape Coordinator. You
must have a Tape Coordinator running whenever you access a tape drive
for use with the Backup System.
.P
.AL
.LI
Make certain that you have the \*Lw\*O (write) and \*Lx\*O (execute) 
permissions on the \*Vdcelocal\*L/var/dfs/backup\*O directory, which is the 
directory in which the Tape Coordinator creates its \*LTL\*O (log) and 
\*LTE\*O (error) files.
.LI
Start a new terminal session on the Tape Coordinator machine to use as the
monitoring window for the Tape Coordinator.  It must remain open while the Tape
Coordinator runs.
.LI
In the newly opened window, issue the \*Lbutc\*O command to
start the Tape Coordinator.  The binary file for the \*Lbutc\*O
program resides in the \*Vdceshared\*L/bin\*O directory.
.iS
\*C$ \*Lbutc\*O [\*L\-tcid \*Vtc_number\*O] [\*L\-debuglevel \*Vtrace_level\*O]
.iE
.P
The \*L\-debuglevel\*O \*Vtrace_level\*O option specifies the type of 
messages to be displayed.  There are two valid arguments:
.VL .75i
.LI "1"
Indicates that the Tape Coordinator is to report on its
activities as it restores filesets, in addition to prompting for new tapes
as necessary.
.LI "0"
Indicates that the Tape Coordinator only prompts for new tapes; it also 
displays some output as necessary for operations that it executes.  This is 
the default.
.LE
.LE
.H 4 "Stopping a Tape Coordinator"
.iX "Tape Coordinators" "stopping"
.P
When you are finished using a Tape Coordinator, you should stop it from
running.  To stop a Tape Coordinator process, enter an interrupt signal
(\*L<Ctrl-c>\*O or its equivalent) in the Tape Coordinator's monitoring window.
.H 4 "Using the Interactive Interface"
.iX "\*Lbak\*O command suite" "interactive mode"
.P
You can use the \*Lbak\*O commands in regular command mode or in interactive
mode.  If you use interactive mode, note the following:
.ML
.LI
You do not need to enter the string \*Lbak\*O with each \*Lbak\*O command; 
the \*Cbak>\*O prompt replaces the command shell prompt.
.LI
You do not have to escape regular expression characters; in regular command
mode, you must place all regular expression characters in "\|" (double quotes)
or escape each with a \*L\e\*O (backslash).
.LI
You can track executing and pending operations with the \*Lbak jobs\*O
command; in regular command mode, you cannot track operations.
.LI
You can cancel currently executing and pending operations with the \*Lbak
kill\*O command; in regular command mode, you cannot use the \*Lbak kill\*O
command.
.LI
You do not have to establish a new connection each time you issue a command,
so execution time is quicker; in regular command mode, each command establishes
new connections to the \*Lbakserver\*O and \*Lflserver\*O processes, as
necessary.
.LE
.nL
.ne 20
.P
Most of the operations described in this chapter are presented in regular
command mode.  Where appropriate, some operations include steps introduced as
\*EOptional\*O to indicate where working in interactive mode could be useful.
The \*Lbak jobs\*O and \*Lbak kill\*O commands can be entered \*Eonly\*O in
interactive mode.
.H 5 "Entering Interactive Mode"
.P
Enter the \*Lbak\*O command to initiate interactive mode:
.iS
\*C$ \*Lbak\*O
.iE
.H 5 "Leaving Interactive Mode"
.P
Enter the \*Lquit\*O command at the \*Cbak>\*O prompt to terminate interactive
mode:
.iS
\*Cbak> \*Lquit\*O
.iE
.H 4 "Using Commands That Execute in the Background"
.iX "\*Lbak\*O command suite" "background execution"
.P
The following commands used with the Backup System execute in the
background:
.ML
.LI
\*Lbak dump\*O
.LI
\*Lbak labeltape\*O
.LI
\*Lbak restoredb\*O
.LI

.LI
\*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O
.LI
\*Lbak savedb\*O
.LI
\*Lbak scantape\*O
.LE
.nL
.ne 20
.P
As soon as you enter a command that executes in the background, the prompt at
which you entered the command returns to the screen.  The command continues to
execute, but you can enter additional commands at the prompt while it executes.
When you enter a command that does not execute in the background, the prompt
does not return until the command is finished executing. (See the appropriate
sections in this chapter and in Chapter 9 for more information about these
commands.)
.H 4 "Checking the Status of a Background Operation"
.iX "-[" "background operations" "checking status"
.iX "\*Lbak\*O command suite" "\*Lstatus\*O"

The \*Lbak dump\*O command is used to perform a dump operation. When you
enter the command, specify the fileset family to be dumped and the level
at which the family is to be dumped.  All entries in the specified fileset
family are dumped according to the dump level that you specify.  If you specify
a full dump level, all of the data in all of the filesets included in the 
specified family is dumped; if you specify an incremental dump, only the data 
in the filesets that has changed since the filesets were dumped at the 
parent of the dump level that you specify is dumped.
.nL
.ne 20
.P
The fileset family and dump level that you specify produce a dump set.  To 
indicate the contents of the dump set, the dump set name consists of the 
fileset family name joined by a dot to the last component of the name of
the dump level at which the family was dumped.  For example, if the 
fileset family named \*Lusersys\*O is dumped at the \*L/weekly/monday\*O 
level, the name of the resulting dump set is \*Lusersys.monday\*O.
.P
The Backup System overwrites a tape that contains an existing dump set only
if both of the following conditions are true:
.ML
.LI
The tape's label contains an acceptable name.  An acceptable name is one that
matches the name of the dump set you want to dump to the tape, in the form
\*Vfileset_family_name\*L.\*Vdump_level\*L.\*Vindex\*O.  Note that a tape's 
index is its position in the sequence of tapes necessary to accommodate the 
dump set; for example, the first tape for a dump set has an index of 1.  A 
tape that is labeled as empty or that has no label is also acceptable.
.LI
The tape's expiration date, if it exists, has expired.  The Backup System
refuses to overwrite a tape whose expiration date has not expired.  Once a
tape's expiration date has expired, the Backup System overwrites the contents
of the tape with a dump set that has an acceptable name.
.LE
.P
Use the \*Lbak labeltape\*O command to overwrite a label that has an
unacceptable name or an unexpired expiration date.  Overwriting a tape's label
removes all obstacles that can prevent it from being overwritten.
.nS "note"
If a dump operation is interrupted or fails for any reason, you cannot be sure
that any fileset is complete on one tape; the Backup Database contains an entry
for the incomplete dump set, which cannot be used to restore data.  Immediately
restart the backup, using the same tape to record the dump set; using the same
tape automatically removes the entry for the incomplete dump set from the
Backup Database.  If you use a different tape, you will need to use the \*Lbak
deletedump\*O command to manually remove the entry for the incomplete dump set
from the database. (See Section 10.4.3 for more information about the \*Lbak
deletedump\*O command.)

.H 3 "Using Tapes with a Backup Operation"
.iX "tapes" "compatibility for full and incremental dumps"
.P
You must place all dumps of a given fileset family (both full and
incremental) onto tapes that are readable by a single tape drive.  This
is required because a single Tape Coordinator performs an entire restore
operation, using a full dump set and any incremental dump sets as
necessary.  If a single Tape Coordinator cannot read all of the tapes on
which the dump sets are recorded, you cannot restore all of the dumps of
the fileset family.
.P
For example, suppose the full dump of a fileset family is stored on
8-mm tape and the incremental dumps, which are done at a different time, are 
stored on streaming cartridge tape.  When you restore a fileset from that 
fileset family, you must use a Tape Coordinator that uses 8-mm tapes 
because a restore always begins with the full dump.  However, you cannot 
restore any of the incremental dumps because the same Tape Coordinator 
cannot read the streaming cartridge tapes and you cannot switch to another 
Tape Coordinator to continue the restore operation.
.P
.iX "\*LTapeConfig\*O file"
Before performing a backup, make sure the tapes are at least as
large as the tape size listed in the \*LTapeConfig\*O file for
the tape drive to be used for the operation.  The Backup System fills a
tape only with the amount of data listed as the capacity for the drive
in the \*LTapeConfig\*O file.  If a tape is larger than the tape
size listed in that file, it simply is not filled to capacity when the
backup is performed.  However, if the tape is smaller than the size
listed in the \*LTapeConfig\*O file, the backup operation fails,
but only after it fills the tape and determines that it is too small for
the drive.
.P
A dump set does not have to fit entirely on a single tape; if the Backup
System reaches the end of a tape while dumping a fileset from a fileset
family, it puts the remaining data on another tape.  The Backup Database
automatically records that the fileset resides on multiple tapes.
.P
.iX "\*Lbak\*O command suite" "dump, previewing effects"
Prior to performing a backup, you can preview the effects of your
command without having the system actually perform the dump.  Simply
include the \*L\-noaction\*O option with the \*Lbak dump\*O
command, specifying the remaining options as you would to really execute
the dump.  This lets you check a fileset family's size before actually
dumping it so that you can calculate the correct number of tapes needed.
.H 3 "Backing Up a Fileset (Creating a Dump Set)"
.P
To back up a fileset, do the following:
.AL
.LI
Verify that you are included in the appropriate administrative lists.
If necessary, issue the \*Lbos lsadmin\*O command to check.
.LI
If it is not already running, start the Tape Coordinator for the tape drive
that you want to use with the operation. (See Section 10.2.2.1 for information
on using the \*Lbutc\*O command to start a Tape Coordinator.)
.LI
\*EOptional\*O.  At this point, you can issue the \*Lbak\*O command at the
system prompt to enter interactive mode. (See Section 10.2.2.3 for the
advantages of interactive mode.) The commands in the following steps assume
that regular command mode is used, not interactive mode.
.LI
Decide which fileset family and dump level to use.  If necessary, use the
\*Lbak lsftfamilies\*O or \*Lbak lsdumps\*O command to display information
about existing fileset families and dump hierarchies.
.LI
Check that you have a sufficient number of tapes; if you do not have
enough tapes, you will not be able to complete the backup.  Also, check
that the tapes are \*Enot\*O smaller than
the tape size listed in the \*LTapeConfig\*O file for the drive.
You must also check that the tapes are properly prelabeled (if
necessary, use the \*Lbak readlabel\*O command to check the
labels); you must relabel any tape that
.ML
.LI
Is labeled with an incorrect name; tape names have the following format:
.P
\*Vfileset_family_name\*L.\*Vdump_level\*L.\*Vindex\*O.
.LI
Has an unexpired date; if a tape has an expiration date associated
with it from a previous dump, you will not be able to use the tape
unless the date is expired.
.LE
.P
If a label is incorrect, use the \*Lbak labeltape\*O command to
label the tape correctly.
.LI
Issue the \*Lbak dump\*O command to dump the fileset family onto
tape:
.iS
\*C$ \*Lbak dump -family \*Vfileset_family_name\*L -level \*Vdump_level\*O \\
[\*L\-tcid \*Vtc_number\*O] [\*L\-noaction\*O]
.iE
.nL
.ne 20
.P
The \*L\-noaction\*O option specifies that all filesets that would be
included in the indicated dump be displayed without the dump actually
being performed.  Specify all other options as you would to actually
perform the operation.
.LI
For manually loaded tape drives, place the correct tape in the drive;
the backup process begins immediately. If more than one tape is
required, you must remain at the console to respond to prompts for
subsequent tapes; if you do not respond immediately, a bell rings
periodically to draw your attention. (If you are using automated
backup equipment, the user-defined configuration file must be set up
to handle tape loading. See Chapter 9 for details.)

The Backup System automatically removes the record of a dump set from the
Backup Database when the tape containing the dump set is overwritten.  The
\*Lbak deletedump\*O command can be used to manually remove information
about a dump set from the Backup Database.  It can be used to remove the
record of a dump set that contains incorrect information (possibly because
a dump operation was interrupted or failed) or for which the corresponding
tape is to be discarded.  Before issuing the \*Lbak deletedump\*O command, 
use the \*Lbak dumpinfo\*O command to display the current dump IDs from

leaving them in the database, while possibly confusing, causes no problems.
Also, as long as the tape that contains the parent dump set remains available,
you can always use the \*Lbak scantape\*O command to restore dump set
information about the parent from that tape to the database, making the dump

The DFS Backup System provides the following commands for restoring data to
the file system in different situations:
.VL 1.40i
.LI "\*Lbak restoreft\*O"
Useful for restoring individual filesets. For example, if a
single fileset becomes corrupted or is accidentally deleted, you can use this
command to restore the fileset.
.LI "\*Lbak restoredisk\*O"
Useful for restoring all of the filesets that reside on a
single aggregate. For example, if a hardware failure corrupts the partition
that houses an aggregate, you can use this command to restore all of the
filesets that reside on the aggregate.
.LI "\*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O"
Useful for restoring all of the filesets that reside on
multiple aggregates or multiple File Server machines. For example, if a
catastrophic system failure corrupts all of the data on a group of File Server
machines, you can use this command to restore all of the filesets that reside
on the machines.
.LE
.P
You can use these commands to restore data to a file system that is different
from the file system from which the data was dumped. For instance, data dumped
from a DCE LFS fileset can be restored to a DCE LFS fileset or to any type of
non-LFS fileset. Similarly, data dumped from a non-LFS fileset can be restored
to a DCE LFS fileset or to a different type of non-LFS fileset. (See your
vendor's documentation to verify the level of support for dump and restore
operations between different types of file systems.)
.P
Restored data is translated into the appropriate format for the file system to
which it is restored. Note that incompatible information may be lost when a
fileset is dumped and restored between different types of file systems. For
example, ACLs on objects in a DCE LFS fileset may be lost if the fileset is
restored to a file system that does not support ACLs.
.P
The commands that restore data determine the tapes and dumps they need
before they begin a restore operation. The commands then prompt for a
given tape only once during a restore operation. Before performing a
restore operation, you can direct these commands to list the tapes
needed to complete the operation. This allows you to locate and
assemble the proper tapes before actually issuing the command. To view
the list of required tapes, include the \*L\-noaction\*O option with
the command along with any other options you intend to use.
.P
.nS "note"
If you have equipment that can automatically retrieve tapes, you can
use a user-defined configuration file to override the prompts to
mount a particular tape. You can also create executable routines to
automatically retrieve the required tapes. See Chapter 9 for details.
.nE
.P
The \*L-noaction\*O option of the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command provides
additional information, such as the filesets that were dumped to tape and the
sites to which the filesets would be restored. You can use the command's
\*L-noaction\*O and \*L-family\*O options to generate information about all of
the filesets in a fileset family. You can write the information to a file and
then modify the file for use with the command's \*L-file\*O option. See Section
10.5.4 for information about using the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command.
.nS "note"
.iX "restore operations" "interruptions"
If a restore operation is interrupted or fails for any reason, you cannot be
sure that any fileset is complete in the file system; immediately restart the
operation.  If you do not, the file system may contain inconsistent information,
which can result in problems in the future.

.iX "\*Lbak\*O command suite" "\*Lrestoreft\*O"
.iX "\*Lbak\*O command suite" "\*Lrestoredisk\*O"
.P
You can perform two types of restore operations: a full restore and a
date-specific restore.  A full restore recreates a fileset as it existed when
it was last dumped, including data from the last full dump and any subsequent
incremental dumps.  A date-specific restore recreates a fileset as it was when
it was last dumped before an indicated date; it includes the last full dump
and any incremental dumps done before the indicated date.
.P
The \*Lbak restoredisk\*O and \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O commands always perform
full restores of every specified fileset. The \*Lbak restoreft\*O command
performs a full restore of each specified fileset by default, but you can
use the command's \*L-date\*O option to perform a date-specific restore.
.P
Using any of the three commands, you can restore data to the location that it
currently occupies, in which case it overwrites the existing version of the
data. Overwrite existing data as follows:
.ML
.LI
To use the \*Lbak restoreft\*O command to restore a fileset to its current
location, specify the fileset's existing site with the \*L\-server\*O and
\*L\-aggregate\*O options.
.LI
To use the \*Lbak restoredisk\*O command to restore all of the filesets on
an aggregate to their current location, omit the \*L\-newserver\*O and
\*L\-newaggregate\*O options from the command; the filesets are restored to
the site at which they currently reside.
.LI
To use the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command to restore filesets to their
current locations, use the \*L-family\*O option to specify the fileset
families from which filesets are to be restored; the filesets are always
restored to their current sites. You can also use the \*L\-file\*O option
of the command to specify a file that names the filesets to be restored and
indicates the locations to which they are to be restored; to overwrite the
filesets, simply specify their current sites as the locations to which they
are to be restored.
.LE
.P
Using any of the commands, you can also restore data to a different location,
as follows:
.ML
.LI
To use the \*Lbak restoreft\*O command to restore a fileset to a different
location, specify a new site with the command's \*L\-server\*O and
\*L\-aggregate\*O options.
.LI
To use the \*Lbak restoredisk\*O command to restore all of the filesets on
an aggregate to a different location, specify a new site with the
\*L\-newserver\*O option, the \*L\-newaggregate\*O option, or both.
.P
.LI
To use the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command to restore filesets to a different
location, use the command's \*L\-file\*O option to specify a file that
identifies new sites for the filesets to be restored.
.LE
.P
If you plan to specify a new site for a restored fileset, you must
remove the current version of the fileset, if it exists, before
restoring it. A restore operation fails if a version of a fileset to
be restored still exists at a site other than the site to which the
fileset is to be restored. If you are using the \*Lbak restoreft\*O
command or the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command with the \*L-file\*O
option to restore individual filesets, you can use either the \*Lfts
zap\*O or \*Lfts delete\*O command to remove the existing filesets. If
you are using the \*Lbak restoredisk\*O command to restore all of the
filesets on an aggregate, you can use only the \*Lfts zap\*O command
to remove the existing filesets.
.P
With the \*Lbak restoreft\*O command, you can preserve the current contents of
a fileset in the file system by restoring the data to a new fileset that has
the same name as the existing fileset with the addition of a distinguishing
extension. You can use the command's \*L\-extension\*O option to specify an
extension such as \*L.restored\*O to be appended to the name of the restored
fileset. A new FLDB entry is created for the fileset and the fileset is
assigned its own fileset ID number. You can restore the new fileset to the
same site as the existing fileset or to a different site.
.P
To restore a fileset that no longer exists in the file system and for which an
entry no longer exists in the FLDB, use the \*Lbak restoreft\*O command, or use
the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command with the \*L-file\*O option. A new FLDB
entry is created for the fileset and a fileset ID number is assigned to it.
The \*Lbak restoredisk\*O command examines the FLDB to determine the filesets
to be restored, so you cannot use the command to restore filesets that no
longer have entries in the FLDB. The same is true of the \*Lbak
restoreftfamily\*O command when it is issued with the \*L-family\*O option.
.P
The following subsections provide detailed information about using the \*Lbak
restoreft\*O, \*Lbak restoredisk\*O, and \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O commands.

.H 3 "Restoring Many Filesets with the bak restoreftfamily Command"
.iX "\*Lbak\*O command suite" "\*Lrestoreftfamily\*O"

Use the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command to restore filesets that
reside on multiple aggregates or on multiple File Server machines. In
situations in which you need to restore large amounts of data to
multiple sites (for example, when recovering from a catastrophic loss
of data), the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command offers significant
advantages over the \*Lbak restoreft\*O and \*Lbak restoredisk\*O
commands. The \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command provides two ways to
restore filesets:
.ML
.LI
You can restore all of the filesets that are included in a fileset family to
the sites at which they currently reside. (See Section 10.5.4.1.)
.LI
You can restore specific individual filesets to the sites at which they
currently reside or to different sites, and you can restore different filesets
to different sites with a single instance of the command. (See Section
10.5.4.2.)
.LE
.P
You can use only one of the two approaches with a single instance of the
command. Regardless of the method you choose, the command always performs a
full restore of all filesets.
.H 4 "Restoring a Fileset Family"
.P
To use the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command to restore all of the filesets
included in a fileset family, specify the name of the fileset family with the
\*L-family\*O option. The command restores the filesets to the sites at which
they currently exist.
.P
You can specify the name of an existing fileset family or you can define a
new fileset family and add entries that correspond to the filesets you need
to restore. The command always reads the FLDB to determine all of the filesets
that match the fields of the entries in a specified fileset family, so you can
create a fileset family expressly for use with the command. Use the \*Lbak
addftfamily\*O and \*Lbak addftentry\*O commands to define a new fileset
family for use with the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command. (See Chapter 9
for information about defining a fileset family.)
.P
In fileset families created for use with the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command,
define entries that match the read/write versions of filesets. The command
automatically appends a \*L.backup\*O extension to the name of a fileset if
it can find no record in the Backup Database of a backup performed for the
read/write version. You can include a \*L.backup\*O extension to match the
backup versions of filesets only if the backup versions were dumped to tape
and the backup versions are still valid in the FLDB entries for the filesets.
.P
To restore the filesets included in a fileset family, do the following:
.AL
.LI
If it is not already running, start the Tape Coordinator for the tape drive
that you want to use with the operation. (See Section 10.2.2.1 for information
on using the \*Lbutc\*O command to start a Tape Coordinator.)
.LI
Verify that you are included in the appropriate administrative lists. If
necessary, issue the \*Lbos lsadmin\*O command to check.
.LI
At this point, you can issue the \*Lbak\*O command at the system
prompt to enter interactive mode. This is optional. (See Section
10.2.2.3 for the advantages of interactive mode.)  The command in the
following step assumes that regular command mode is used, not
interactive mode.
.LI
Issue the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command with the \*L-family\*O
option, as follows:
.iS
\*C$ \*Lbak restoreftfamily -family \*Vfileset_family_name\*O [\*L-tcid \*Vtc_number\*O] [\*L-noaction\*O]
.iE
.P
The \*L\-noaction\*O option directs the command to display the list of
filesets that would be restored and the tapes necessary to restore them
without performing the actual operation.
.LE
.H 4 "Restoring Individual Filesets"
.P
To use the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command to restore individual filesets,
specify the name of a file that includes a single entry for each fileset to
be restored. The command restores each fileset to the site specified with the
fileset's entry in the named file. A file to be used with the command must
include entries of the following form:
.oS
\*Vmachine\*C \*Vaggregate\*C \*Vfileset\*C \*O[\*Vcomments...\*O]
.oE
.P
An entry for a fileset must occupy a single line of the file, and each entry
must provide the following information:
.VL
.LI "\*Vmachine\*O"
Specifies the File Server machine to which the fileset is to be restored.
Identify the machine by its DCE pathname, its host name, or its IP address.
.LI "\*Vaggregate\*O"
Specifies the aggregate to which the fileset is to be restored. Identify the
aggregate by its device name or by its aggregate name.
.LI "\*Vfileset\*O"
Specifies the fileset to be restored. Specify the name of the read/write
version of the fileset. (Note that you can specify the name of the backup
version of the fileset if that version was dumped to tape.)
.LE
.P
Any \*Vcomments\*O in the form of additional text are always optional; the
command treats all remaining text as a comment and ignores it. Do not use
wildcards (\*L.*\*O, for example) in an entry. Note that if a fileset currently
exists at a site other than the site you specify, you must remove the existing
version of the fileset before issuing the command.
.P
When issued with the \*L-noaction\*O option, the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O
command generates output that, with slight modification, is suitable for use
as input to the command's \*L-file\*O option. You can use the \*L-noaction\*O
option with the command's \*L-family\*O option to write a list of filesets and
their sites to a file. You can then prune the file to include a single entry
for each fileset that you need to restore. This approach is useful for
restoring only certain filesets from a fileset family or for restoring the
filesets to new sites. Note again that the \*L\-family\*O option provides
information only for filesets that have entries in the FLDB.
.P
To restore individual filesets, do the following:
.AL
.LI
Create a file that contains an entry for each fileset you want to restore.
Each entry must name the machine to which the fileset is to be restored, the
aggregate to which the fileset is to be restored, and the fileset to be
restored. Use a single line in the file for each entry, and use a single entry
for each fileset (the command ignores subsequent entries for the same fileset).
You can use a text editor to create the file manually, or you can use the
\*L-noaction\*O to write a list of filesets and their sites to a file, which
you can then modify for use with the command.
.LI
If it is not already running, start the Tape Coordinator for the tape drive
that you want to use with the operation. (See Section 10.2.2.1 for information
on using the \*Lbutc\*O command to start a Tape Coordinator.)
.LI
Verify that you are included in the appropriate administrative lists. If
necessary, issue the \*Lbos lsadmin\*O command to check.
.LI
At this point, you can issue the \*Lbak\*O command at the system
prompt to enter interactive mode. This is optional. (See Section
10.2.2.3 for the advantages of interactive mode.)  The command in the
following step assumes that regular command mode is used, not
interactive mode.
.LI
Issue the \*Lbak restoreftfamily\*O command with the \*L-file\*O
option, as follows:
.iS
\*C$ \*Lbak restoreftfamily -file \*Vfilename\*O [\*L-tcid \*Vtc_number\*O] [\*L-noaction\*O]
.iE
.P
The \*L\-file\*O \*Vfilename\*O option provides the full pathname of a file
that contains an entry for each fileset to be restored.
.P
The \*L\-noaction\*O option directs the command to display the list of
filesets that would be restored and the tapes necessary to restore them
without performing the actual operation.

A copy of the Backup Database can be installed on any server machine in a

Dump set records, which list the fileset family and the tape used in each dump
set
.LI
Administrative records, which list the fileset families, dump levels, and tape
hosts
.LE
.P
Because information about dumps is difficult to recreate, it is important 
that you copy the Backup Database with the \*Lbak savedb\*O command 
periodically, perhaps weekly.  When you issue the \*Lbak savedb\*O command, 
the entire database is copied to tape.  One tape needs to be designated as 
a Backup Database tape; when the command is issued, the tape is labeled 
with the name \*Lbak_db_dump.1\*O.
.P
If the Backup Database becomes damaged (for instance, if the disk that houses
the database becomes damaged), you must delete the old database and restore an
entirely new version from its backup tape.  You can use the \*Lbak verifydb\*O
command to determine if the Backup Database is damaged.
.P
Do \*Enot\*O attempt to recover information from a corrupted database. 
Instead, use the \*Lbos stop\*O command to shut down \*Eall\*O \*Lbakserver\*O

each machine on which it is located; the files for the Backup Database are 
named \*Vdcelocal\*L/var/dfs/backup/bkdb.*\*O on each machine on which the 
database resides.
.P
Once the database is removed, use \*Lbos start\*O to restart \*Eall\*O
\*Lbakserver\*O processes on the machines where they were running.  Use
\*Lbak addhost\*O to add a tape host for the Tape Coordinator from which you
will restore the Backup Database, and use \*Lbak restoredb\*O to restore the
new version of the database.  Recreate fileset information in the database as
needed, restoring dump set information that you may have lost since the last 
backup of filesets; note that any fileset family, fileset family entry, or 
host information updated since the last backup of the Backup Database must 
be recreated as well.

.P
Use the \*Lbak scantape\*O command to extract dump set
information from a backup tape and add it to the Backup Database.  When
you issue this command, you must place the backup tapes into the drive
in sequential order.  The system verifies that each tape is undamaged by
checking the end-of-file markers that the Backup System inserts at the
beginning and end of each fileset.  If the markers are missing, the tape is
assumed to be damaged and cannot be used for recovering data.  To add
information to the database, the entire tape must be undamaged, and the
Backup Database must not contain an entry with the same dump ID as an
entry being added.
.P
To add recovered data to the Backup Database, do the following:

Verify that you are included in the appropriate administrative lists.  If
necessary, issue the \*Lbos lsadmin\*O command to check.

Insert the first backup tape from the dump sequence into the tape drive, and
issue the \*Lbak scantape\*O command \*Ewithout\*O the \*L\-dbadd\*O option.

If the output indicates that the tape is undamaged, issue the \*Lbak

the information from the tape to the Backup Database.
.iS
\*C$ \*Lbak scantape \*O[\*L\-dbadd\*O] [\*L\-tcid \*Vtc_number\*O]
.iE
.P
The \*L\-dbadd\*O option indicates that information extracted from the tape 
is to be added to the Backup Database; information is added only if the tape 
is undamaged and the Backup Database does not have an entry with the same 
dump ID as an entry being added.

.P
When you issue a command in interactive mode, the resulting operation is
assigned a unique job ID number.  While in interactive mode, you can use
the \*Lbak jobs\*O command to list job ID numbers and status information about
all of the operations currently executing or pending in the queue on a tape 
drive (operations that do not involve tapes execute immediately and do not 
appear on the list).  You can use the job ID number of an operation (or its 
dump set name if it is a dump) with the \*Lbak kill\*O command to cancel an 
operation that is executing or that is in the queue.
.P
If you cancel an operation that is in the queue, it is removed from the queue
with no other effects.  Furthermore, if you cancel a tape labeling or tape
scanning operation as it executes, the operation simply terminates with no
further effects.  However, canceling a dump or restore operation while it
executes can produce inconsistencies on a backup tape or in the file system.
.P
If you cancel a backup operation while it is executing, all filesets written
to tape \*Ebefore\*O the \*Lkill\*O signal is received are complete and 
usable on the tape.  However, filesets being written \*Ewhen\*O the signal 
is received may be incomplete and \*Eshould not be used\*O.
.P
If you cancel a restore operation while it is executing, all completely
restored filesets are online and usable.  However, because most restore
operations require data from multiple tapes (a full dump tape and one or more
incremental dump tapes), most filesets are usually not completely restored.  If
the \*Lkill\*O signal occurs before the system accesses all of the necessary 
tapes, most filesets are not restored to the desired date or version 
and \*Eshould not be used\*O.
.P
If the interrupted restore operation is overwriting one or more existing
filesets, the filesets can be lost entirely; however, the data being restored
still exists on tape.  In general, to avoid the inconsistencies that can result
from an interrupted restore operation, reinitiate the restore operation.
