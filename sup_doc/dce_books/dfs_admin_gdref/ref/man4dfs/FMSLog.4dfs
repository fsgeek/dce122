.iX "\*LFMSLog\*O file"
.iX "\*Lfms\*O command" 
.SH "NAME"
\*LFMSLog\*O \- Lists the output of the \*Lfms\*O command
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \*LFMSLog\*O file lists the output generated by the \*Lfms\*O (file mark
size) command.  The \*Lfms\*O command determines the tape capacity and
end-of-file (EOF) mark size for a tape drive.  The command both displays its
output on the screen and writes it to the \*LFMSLog\*O file, which it creates
in the directory from which it is issued.
.PP
The command creates the \*LFMSLog\*O file if it does not already exist in the
current working directory, in which case the issuer of the command must have
write, execute, and insert permissions on the directory from
which the command is issued.  If the file already exists in the current working
directory, the command reinitializes the file (clears its contents) before
writing to it, in which case the issuer needs only write permission on
the file.
.PP
The information written to the \*LFMSLog\*O file is useful for specifying a
tape drive's configuration parameters in the \*LTapeConfig\*O file on a Tape
Coordinator machine.  The \*LFMSLog\*O file is an ASCII file, so it can be
viewed with the \*Lmore\*O command (or a similar command appropriate to the
local operating system), which requires read permission on the file.
.PP
The tape size reported in the file should be reduced by 10 to 15% before being
used in the \*LTapeConfig\*O file.  The EOF mark size in the file should be
increased by 10 to 15% before being used in the \*LTapeConfig\*O file.
.PP
The \*LFMSLog\*O file is not created if a problem with the tape drive prevents
execution of the \*Lfms\*O command.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
An example of the \*LFMSLog\*O file follows.  The file lists the tape capacity
and the size of the EOF mark for the tape drive used in the \*Lfms\*O command.
The tape drive used in the example uses tapes 2,136,604,672 bytes in size, 
and creates EOF marks of size 1,910,220 bytes in size.
