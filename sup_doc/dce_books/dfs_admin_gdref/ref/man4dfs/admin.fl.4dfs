.SH "NAME"
\*Ladmin.fl\*O \- Contains the administrative list for the Fileset Location
(FL) Server
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \*Ladmin.fl\*O file is an administrative list of all users and groups
that can use the Fileset Location (FL) Server to modify the Fileset Location
Database (FLDB).  A master copy of the FLDB resides on one server machine;
other server machines (usually two) house replicated copies of the database.
Any machine that houses a copy of the FLDB is referred to as a Fileset Database
machine.  The FL Server, or \*Lflserver\*O process, must run on all Fileset
Database machines.
.PP
An \*Ladmin.fl\*O file must reside on each Fileset Database machine.  For the
most part, the \*Ladmin.fl\*O file contains the UUIDs of users and groups.
However, it must also contain the abbreviated DFS server principals of all
Fileset Database machines in the local cell to allow the synchronization
site for the FLDB to distribute changes to the secondary sites.  The server
principals can be present as members of a group included in the list.
.PP
Each time the Fileset Location Server is started on any machine, it
automatically creates the \*Vdcelocal\*L/var/dfs/admin.fl\*O file if the
file does not already exist.  You can also create the file by including the
\%\*L-createlist\*O option with the \*Lbos addadmin\*O command.  Once the
\*Ladmin.fl\*O file exists, principals and groups can be added to it with the
\*Lbos addadmin\*O command, and they can be removed from it with the \*Lbos
rmadmin\*O command.  The \*Lbos lsadmin\*O command can be used to list the
principals and groups currently in the file.  Because administrative lists are
stored as binary files, you must use these commands to modify them; you cannot
edit them directly.
.PP
The \*Ladmin.fl\*O file should be stored in the directory named
\*Vdcelocal\*L/var/dfs\*O on each Fileset Database machine.  If it is stored
in a different directory, the full pathname of the file must be specified when
the FL Server is started.  Do not create multiple copies of the \*Ladmin.fl\*O
file and store them in different directories on the same machine; unauthorized
users may be able to use the extraneous copies to access the FLDB.
.PP
A single version of the \*Ladmin.fl\*O file should be created and maintained on
a System Control machine.  The \*Lupclient\*O processes running on the cell's
Fileset Database machines can then update their local copies of the file via
the \*Lupserver\*O process running on the System Control machine.
.PP
.ne 10
Independent versions of the \*Ladmin.fl\*O file should not be maintained on
each Fileset Database machine in a cell.  Because the FLDB is a Ubik database,
any of the secondary sites may be obliged to assume the role of synchronization
site for the FLDB at any time.  A system administrator listed in the
\*Ladmin.fl\*O file on the machine housing the former synchronization site
may not be listed in the \*Ladmin.fl\*O file on the machine housing the new
synchronization site.  The administrator, who could issue commands that affect
the FLDB on the former machine, may not be able to issue commands that affect
the database on the new machine, or vice versa.
