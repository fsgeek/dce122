.iX "\*LFlLog\*O file"
.iX "Fileset Location Server" "log file"
.SH "NAME"
\*LFlLog\*O \- Contains messages generated by the Fileset Location Server
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \*LFlLog\*O file contains execution messages and error messages generated
by the Fileset Location Server (\*Lflserver\*O process).  The Fileset Location
Server runs on every Fileset Database machine in a cell, providing the
interface by which authorized users can modify the Fileset Location Database
(FLDB).
.PP
If the \*LFlLog\*O file does not already exist when the Fileset Location
Server starts, the server process creates the file in the directory named
\*Edcelocal\*L/var/dfs/adm\*O.  The process then appends any subsequent
messages to the file once it exists.  If the file exists when the Fileset
Location Server starts, the process moves the current version of the file to
the \*LFlLog.old\*O file in the same directory (overwriting the current
\*LFlLog.old\*O file if it exists) before creating a new version to which
to append messages.
.PP
The process can write different types of output to the file, depending on the
actions it performs and any problems it encounters.  The file can be viewed
with the \*Lbos getlog\*O command.  Because it is an ASCII file, it can also be
viewed with the \*Lmore\*O command (or a similar command appropriate to the
local operating system), which requires read permission on the file.
.PP
Events are recorded in the log file only at their completion, so the process
does not use the file to reconstruct failed operations.  However, the contents
of the log file can help in evaluating server process failures and other
problems.
