.sE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.VL
.LI "\*L\-server \*Vmachine\*O"
Names the server machine whose keytab file is to have obsolete keys removed
from it.  The BOS Server on this machine executes the command.  To run this
command using a privileged identity, specify the full DCE pathname of the
machine.  To run this command using the unprivileged identity \*Lnobody\*O (the
equivalent of running the command with the \*L\-noauth\*O option), specify the
machine's host name or IP address.
.LI "\*L\-principal \*Vname\*O"
Provides the principal name for which obsolete keys are to be removed from the
keytab file.  The default is the DFS principal name of the machine specified by
\*L\-server\*O.
.LI "\*L\-noauth\*O"
Directs \*Lbos\*O to use the unprivileged identity \*Lnobody\*O as the
identity of the issuer of the command.  The command fails if you use this
option and DFS authorization checking is not disabled on the machine specified
by \*L\-server\*O.  If you use this option, do not use the \*L\-localauth\*O
option.
.LI "\*L\-localauth\*O"
Directs \*Lbos\*O to use the DFS server principal name of the machine on which
the command is issued as the identity of the issuer.  Use this option only if
the command is issued from a DFS server machine (a machine that has a DFS
server principal in the local Registry Database).  You must be logged into the
server machine as \*Lroot\*O for this option to work.  If you use this option,
do not use the \*L\-noauth\*O option.
.LI "\*L\-help\*O"
Prints the online help for this command.  All other valid options specified with
this option are ignored.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \*Lbos gckeys\*O command removes obsolete server encryption keys from the
\*L/krb5/v5srvtab\*O keytab file on the server machine specified by
\*L\-server\*O.  Obsolete keys associated only with the principal name specified
by \*L\-principal\*O are removed from the keytab file; the DFS principal name of
the server machine specified with \*L\-server\*O is used by default.
.PP
Keys are removed based on age and lack of use.  The removal process, referred
to as \*Egarbage collection\*O, affects only the keytab file stored on the
local disk of the machine indicated by \*L\-server\*O; it has no effect on the
Registry Database.
.SS "Privilege Required"
.PP
You must be listed in the \*Ladmin.bos\*O file on the machine specified by
\*L\-server\*O.
.SH "OUTPUT"
If the packet privacy protection level is not available to you, the command
displays the following message reporting that the BOS Server is using the
packet integrity protection level instead:
.oS
\*CData encryption unsupported by RPC. Continuing without it.\*O
.oE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The following command removes obsolete keys associated with the principal
\*Lhosts/fs1/dfs-server\*O from the keytab file on the server machine named
\*L/.../abc.com/hosts/fs3\*O.  Note that the keys being removed are associated
with the principal name of a machine different from the one whose BOS Server
is executing the command.
