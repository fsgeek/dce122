.ad b
.sE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.VL
.LI "\*L\-server \*Vmachine\*O"
Names the server machine that houses the administrative list from which
principals, groups, or both are to be removed.  The BOS Server on this machine
executes the command.  To run this command using a privileged identity, specify
the full DCE pathname of the machine.  To run this command using the
unprivileged identity \*Lnobody\*O (the equivalent of running the command with
the \*L\-noauth\*O option), specify the machine's host name or IP address.
.LI "\*L\-adminlist \*Vfilename\*O"
Names the administrative list from which principals, groups, or both are to be
removed.  The complete pathname is unnecessary if the list is stored in the
default configuration directory (\*Edcelocal\*O\*L/var/dfs\*O).
.LI "\*L\-principal \*Vname\*O"
Specifies the principal name of each user or server machine to be removed from
the administrative list.  A user from the local cell can be specified by a full
or abbreviated principal name (for example,
\*L/.../\*Ecellname\*L/\*Eusername\*O or just \*Eusername\*O); a user from a
foreign cell can be specified only by a full principal name.  A server machine
from the local cell can be specified by a full or abbreviated principal name
(for example, \*L/.../\*Ecellname\*L/hosts/\*Ehostname\*L/self\*O or just
\*Lhosts/\*Ehostname\*L/self\*O); a server machine from a foreign cell can
be specified only by a full principal name.
.LI "\*L\-group \*Vname\*O"
Specifies the name of each group to be removed from the administrative list.
A group from the local cell can be specified by a full or abbreviated group
name (\*L/.../\*Ecellname\*L/\*Egroup_name\*O or just
\*Egroup_name\*O); a group from a foreign cell can be specified only by a full
group name.
.nL
.ne 10
.LI "\*L\-removelist\*O"
Specifies that the file indicated with \*L\-adminlist\*O is to be removed if
it is empty either when the command is issued or after any principals or
groups specified with the command are removed.  This option has no effect if
the specified file is not empty when the command is issued or after any
indicated principals or groups are removed.
.LI "\*L\-noauth\*O"
Directs \*Lbos\*O to use the unprivileged identity \*Lnobody\*O as the
identity of the issuer of the command.  The command fails if you use this
option and DFS authorization checking is not disabled on the machine specified
by \*L\-server\*O.  If you use this option, do not use the \*L\-localauth\*O
option.
.LI "\*L\-localauth\*O"
Directs \*Lbos\*O to use the DFS server principal name of the machine on which
the command is issued as the identity of the issuer.  Use this option only if
the command is issued from a DFS server machine (a machine that has a DFS
server principal in the local Registry Database).  You must be logged into the
server machine as \*Lroot\*O for this option to work.  If you use this option,
do not use the \*L\-noauth\*O option.
.LI "\*L\-help\*O"
Prints the online help for this command.  All other valid options specified
with this option are ignored.
.LE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \*Lbos rmadmin\*O command removes the specified users, groups, and servers
from the administrative list specified by the \*L\-adminlist\*O option on the
server machine specified by the \*L\-server\*O option.  The principal (login)
names of users and the principal names of server machines to be removed from
the administrative list are specified with the \*L\-principal\*O option; the
names of groups to be removed from the list are specified with the \*L\-group\*O
option.  Principals removed from the administrative list either directly (with
the \*L\-principal\*O option) or indirectly (as members of groups indicated with
the \*L\-group\*O option) can no longer issue administrative commands for the
DFS server process associated with the list.
.PP
The default path for administrative lists is the configuration directory
(\*Edcelocal\*O\*L/var/dfs\*O).  If the specified list is stored in the
default directory, only the specific filename is required.  If the specified
list is stored elsewhere, the pathname to the file that was used when the
associated server process was started is required.
.nL
.ne 2.5i
.SS "Privilege Required"
.PP
The issuer must be listed in the \*Ladmin.bos\*O file on the machine specified
by \*L\-server\*O.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The following command removes the former administrative users \*Lsmith\*O and
\*Ljones\*O from the \*Ladmin.bos\*O file on \*Lfs1\*O:
.iS
\*C$\*O \*Lbos rmadmin -server /.../abc.com/hosts/fs1 -adminlist admin.bos \e
