.SH "NAME"
\*Lbos lsadmin\*O \- Lists the users, groups, and servers from an
administrative list
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sS
\*Lbos lsadmin -server \*Vmachine\*L -adminlist \*Vfilename\*O [{\*L\-noauth\*O
| \*L\-localauth\*O}] [\*L\-help\*O]
.sE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.VL
.LI "\*L\-server \*Vmachine\*O"
Names the server machine that houses the administrative list whose principals
and groups are to be displayed.  The BOS Server on this machine executes the
command.  Specify the machine's DCE pathname, its host name, or its IP address.
.LI "\*L\-adminlist \*Vfilename\*O"
Names the administrative list whose principals and groups are to be displayed.
The complete pathname is unnecessary if the list is stored in the default
configuration directory (\*Edcelocal\*O\*L/var/dfs\*O).
.LI "\*L\-noauth\*O"
Directs \*Lbos\*O to use the unprivileged identity \*Lnobody\*O as the
identity of the issuer of the command.  If you use this option, do not use the
\*L\-localauth\*O option.
.LI "\*L\-localauth\*O"
Directs \*Lbos\*O to use the DFS server principal name of the machine on which
the command is issued as the identity of the issuer.  Use this option only if
the command is issued from a DFS server machine (a machine that has a DFS
server principal in the local Registry Database).  You must be logged into the
server machine as \*Lroot\*O for this option to work.  If you use this option,
do not use the \*L\-noauth\*O option.
.LI "\*L\-help\*O"
Prints the online help for this command.  All other valid options specified with
this option are ignored.
.LE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \*Lbos lsadmin\*O command lists the principal names of users and server
machines and the names of groups found in the administrative list specified
by the \*L\-adminlist\*O option on the server machine specified by the
\*L\-server\*O option.  Principals whose names are specified in the
administrative list or that are members of groups specified in the list can
issue administrative commands for the DFS server process associated with the
list.
.PP
The default path for the administrative lists is the
configuration directory (\*Edcelocal\*L/var/dfs\*O).  If the specified list is
stored in the default directory, only the specific filename is required.  If
the specified list is stored elsewhere, the pathname to the file that was used
when the associated server process was started is required.
.PP
Use the \*Lbos addadmin\*O command to add principals and groups to an
administrative list.  Use the \*Lbos rmadmin\*O command to remove principals
and groups from an administrative list.
.SS "Privilege Required"
.PP
No privileges are required.
.SH "OUTPUT"
The command displays the output
.oS
Admin Users are:
.oE
followed by the principal name of each user and machine and the name of each
group contained in the administrative list.  Names from the local cell are
displayed in an abbreviated form (for example, \*Eusername\*O for
\*L/.../\*Ecellname\*L/\*Eusername\*O); names from foreign cells are displayed
in full.  Each name is preceded by one of the following strings:
.VL
.LI "\*Cuser:\*O"
Precedes the principal name of each user or machine from the local cell
.LI "\*Cforeign_user:\*O"
Precedes the principal name of each user or machine from a foreign cell
.LI "\*Cgroup:\*O"
Precedes the name of each group from the local cell
.LI "\*Cforeign_group:\*O"
Precedes the name of each group from a foreign cell
.LE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
The following command lists the members of the \*Ladmin.bos\*O file on the
server machine named \*Lfs1\*O.  The administrative list contains two users, a
server machine, and two groups, all of which are from the local cell.
