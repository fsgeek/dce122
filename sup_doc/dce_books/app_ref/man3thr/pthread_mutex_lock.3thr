.SH "Description"
.PP
The \*Lpthread_mutex_lock(\|)\*O
routine locks a mutex.  If the mutex is locked when a thread calls this
routine, the thread waits for the mutex to become available.
.PP
The thread that has locked a mutex becomes its current owner and remains the
owner until the same thread has unlocked it.  This routine returns with the
mutex in the locked state and with the current thread as the mutex's current
owner.
.PP
If you specified a fast mutex in a call to
\*Lpthread_mutexattr_setkind_np(\|)\*O,
a deadlock can result
if the current owner of a mutex calls this routine in an attempt to lock the
mutex a second time.  If you specified a recursive mutex in a call to
\*Lpthread_mutexattr_setkind_np(\|)\*O, the current owner of a mutex can
relock the same mutex without blocking.  If you specify a nonrecursive
mutex in a call to \*Lpthread_mutexattr_setkind_np(\|)\*O, an error is
returned and the thread does not block if the current owner of a mutex
calls this routine in an attempt to lock the mutex a second time.
.PP
The preemption of a lower-priority thread that locks a mutex possibly
results in
the indefinite blocking of higher-priority threads waiting for the same
mutex.  The execution of the waiting higher-priority threads is blocked for
as long as there is a sufficient number of runnable threads of any priority
between the lower-priority and higher-priority
values.  Priority inversion occurs
when any resource is shared between threads with different priorities.
