.SH "Description"
.PP
The \*Lpthread_lock_global_np(\|)\*O
routine locks the global mutex.  If the global mutex is currently held
by another thread when a thread calls this routine, the thread waits for the
global mutex to become available.
.PP
The thread that has locked the global mutex becomes its current owner and
remains the owner until the same thread has unlocked it.  This routine
returns with the global mutex in the locked state and with the current
thread as the global mutex's current owner.
.PP
Use the global mutex when calling a library package that is not designed to run
in a multithreaded environment. (Unless the documentation for a library
function specifically states that it is compatible with multithreading,
assume that it is not compatible; in other words, assume it is nonreentrant.)
.PP
The global mutex is one lock.  Any code that calls any function that is not
known to be reentrant uses the same lock.  This prevents dependencies among
threads calling library functions and those functions calling other
functions, and so on.
.PP
The global mutex is a recursive mutex.  A thread that has locked the global
mutex can relock it without deadlocking. (The locking thread must call
\*Lpthread_\%unlock_\%global_\%np(\|)\*O as many times as it called this routine
to allow another thread to lock the global mutex.)
.PP
This routine is a new primitive.
