.SH "Name"
\*Lpthread_unlock_global_np\*O - Unlocks a global mutex
.SH "Synopsis"
.sS
\*L#include <pthread.h>
.sp .4v
\*Lvoid pthread_unlock_global_np\*L(\|);
.sE
.SH "Description"
The \*Lpthread_unlock_global_np(\|)\*O
routine unlocks the global mutex when each call to
\*Lpthread_lock_global_np(\|)\*O is matched by a call to this
routine.  For example, if you called \*Lpthread_lock_global_np(\|)\*O three
times, \*Lpthread_\%unlock_\%global_\%np(\|)\*O unlocks the global mutex when you
call it the third time.
If no threads are waiting for the global mutex, it becomes unlocked
with no current owner.  If one or more threads are waiting to lock the
global mutex, one thread returns from its call to
\*Lpthread_lock_global_np(\|)\*O.  The scheduling policy is used to
determine which thread acquires the global mutex.  For the policies
\*LSCHED_FIFO\*O and \*LSCHED_RR\*O, a blocked thread is
chosen in priority order.
.PP
The results of calling this routine are unpredictable if the global mutex is
already unlocked.  The results of calling this routine are also unpredictable
if the global mutex is owned by a thread other than the calling thread.
.PP
This routine is a new primitive.
.SH "Return Values"
No value is returned.
