.LI "\*Vstate\*O"
State of asynchronous cancelability set for the calling thread.  On return,
receives the prior state of asynchronous cancelability.  Valid values are as
follows:
.VL
.LI "\*LCANCEL_ON\*O"
Asynchronous cancelability is enabled.
.LI "\*LCANCEL_OFF\*O"
Asynchronous cancelability is disabled.

.SH "Description"
.PP
The \*Lpthread_setasynccancel(\|)\*O  routine enables or disables the
current thread's asynchronous cancelability and returns the previous
asynchronous cancelability state.
.PP
When general cancelability is set to \*LCANCEL_OFF\*O, a cancel cannot
be delivered to the thread, even if a cancelable routine is called or
asynchronous cancelability is enabled.  When general cancelability is
set to \*LCANCEL_ON\*O, cancelability depends on the state of the
thread's asynchronous cancelability.
.PP
When general cancelability is set to \*LCANCEL_ON\*O and asynchronous
cancelability is set to \*LCANCEL_OFF\*O, the thread can only receive
a cancel at specific cancellation points (for example, condition waits,
thread joins, and calls to the \*Lpthread_testcancel(\|)\*O routine).  If both general
cancelability and asynchronous cancelability are set to
\*LCANCEL_ON\*O, the thread can be canceled at any point in its
execution.
.PP
When a thread is created, the default asynchronous cancelability state is
\*LCANCEL_OFF\*O.
.PP
.ne 8
If you call this routine to enable asynchronous cancels, call it in a region
of code where asynchronous delivery of cancels is disabled by a
previous call to this routine.  Do not call threads routines in
regions of code where asynchronous delivery of cancels is enabled.
The previous state of asynchronous delivery can be restored later by another
call to this routine.
.nL
.ne 1.5i
.SH "Return Values"
On successful completion, the previous state of asynchronous cancelability
is returned.  If the function fails, -1 is returned.  Following are the
possible return values and the possible corresponding values (if any) for
\*Lerrno\*O:
...\" If the function fails, \*Lerrno\*O may be set to one of the
...\" following values:
