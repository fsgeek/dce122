.VL
.LI "\*Vh\*O"
A handle referring to the target object.
Use \*Lsec_acl_bind(\|)\*O to create this handle.
.LI "\*Vmanager_type\*O"
A pointer to the UUID identifying the type of the ACL manager in
question.  There may be more than one type of ACL manager
protecting the object whose ACL is bound to the input handle.  Use
this parameter to distinguish them.  Use
\*Lsec_\%acl_\%get_\%manager_\%types(\|)\*O to acquire a list of the
manager types protecting a given object.
.LI "\*Vsubject\*O"
A privilege attribute certificate (PAC) for the subject process.
The PAC contains the name and UUID of the principal and cell of the
subject process, as well as a list of any groups to which it belongs.
The PAC also contains a flag (named \*Lauthenticated\*O).  When set, it
indicates that the certificate was obtained from an authenticated source.
When not set, the certificate must not be trusted.  (The field is
FALSE when it was obtained from the \*Lrpc_auth(3rpc)\*O layer and the
protect level was set to \*Lrpc_c_protect_level_none\*O.
This indicates that no authentication
protocol was actually used in the remote procedure call; the identity was
simply transmitted from the caller to the callee.  If an authentication
protocol was used, then the flag is set to TRUE.)
.PP
.ne 8
If a null PAC is passed, the subject is treated as an anonymous user,
matching only the \*Lany_other\*O and \*Lunauthenticated\*O entries
(if they exist) on the ACL.
.PP
A server uses \*Lrpc_binding_inq_auth_client(\|)\*O to acquire a
certificate for the client process.
.LI "\*Vdesired_permset\*O"
A permission set in \*Lsec_acl_permset_t\*O form containing the desired
privileges.  This is a 32-bit set of permission flags supported by
the manager type.
.LE
.SS "Output"
.VL
.LI "\*Vstatus\*O"
A pointer to the completion status.  On successful completion,
the routine returns \*Lerror_status_ok\*O.
Otherwise, it returns an error.
.LE
.nL
.ne 1.5i
.SH "Description"
.PP
The \*Lsec_acl_test_access_on_behalf(\|)\*O routine determines if the
specified ACL contains entries that grant the privileges specified in
\*Vdesired_permset\*O to the subject process.
An application generally inquires about only the minimum set
of privileges needed to accomplish a specific task.
.SS "Permissions Required"
.PP
The \*Lsec_acl_test_access_on_behalf(\|)\*O routine requires at least one
permission of any kind on the object for which the privileges
are to be tested.  Both the calling process and the identified subject
must have permission on the object.
...\" 
.PP
\*LNote:\*O This operation is obsolete, but is documented for backward
compatibility. \*Lsec_id_pac_t\*O is no longer the data structure used
for identities (for further information, see the \*Lsec_cred_*(3sec)\*O
routines), and delegation subsumes the functionality that the
\*Lsec_acl_test_access_on_behalf(\|)\*O routine was originally intended
to provide. ACL managers do not have to implement the server side of this
functionality to be DCE compliant, and therefore clients should not rely
on its being available in servers.

.SH "Return Values"
.PP
If the routine completes successfully (with a completion status of \*Lerror_status_ok\*O)
it returns a value of
.ML
.LI
TRUE, if the caller has any access (at
least one permission of any kind), and the subject has
the \*Vdesired_permset\*O privileges.
.LI
FALSE, if both the caller and the subject
have any access, but the subject does not have the
\*Vdesired_permset\*O privileges.
.LE
.PP
If the routine does not complete successfully, it returns
a bad completion status code and a return value of FALSE.
