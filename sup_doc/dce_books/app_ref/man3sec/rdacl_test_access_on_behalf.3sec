.SH "Parameters"
.SS "Input"
.VL
.LI "\*Vh\*O"
A handle referring to the target object.
.LI "\*Vcomponent_name\*O"
A character string containing the name of the target object.
.LI "\*Vmanager_type\*O"
A pointer to the UUID identifying the type of the ACL manager in
question.  There may be more than one type of ACL manager
protecting the object whose ACL is bound to the input handle.  Use
this parameter to distinguish them.  Use
\*Lsec_\%acl_\%get_\%manager_\%types(\|)\*O to acquire a list of the
manager types protecting a given object.
.LI "\*Vsubject\*O"
A privilege attribute certificate (PAC) for the subject process.
The PAC contains the name and UUID of the principal and parent cell of the
subject process, as well as a list of any groups to which it belongs.
The PAC also contains a flag (named \*Lauthenticated\*O).  When set, it
indicates that the certificate was obtained from an authenticated source.
When not set, the certificate must not be trusted.  
.PP
.ne 10
The field is
FALSE when it was obtained from the \*Lrpc_auth\*O layer and the
protect level was set to \*Lrpc_\%c_\%protect_\%level_\%none\*O.
This indicates that no authentication
protocol was actually used in the remote procedure call; the identity was
simply transmitted from the caller to the callee.  If an authentication
protocol was used, then the flag is set to TRUE.
A server uses \*Lrpc_binding_inq_auth_client(\|)\*O to acquire a
certificate for the client process.
.LI "\*Vdesired_permset\*O"
A permission set in \*Lsec_acl_permset_t\*O form containing the desired
privileges.  This is a 32-bit set of permission flags supported by
the manager type.
.LE
.SS "Output"
.VL
.LI "\*Vstatus\*O"
A pointer to the completion status.  On successful completion,
the routine returns \*Lerror_status_ok\*O.
Otherwise, it returns an error.
.LE

.ne 1.5i
.SH "Description"
.PP
The \*Lrdacl_test_access_on_behalf(\|)\*O routine determines if the
specified ACL contains entries granting privileges to the subject, a
process besides the calling process, matching those in
\*Vdesired_permset\*O.  This routine succeeds only if the access is
available to both the caller process as well as the subject identified in
the call.  An application will generally only inquire after the minimum set
of privileges needed to accomplish a specific task.
.nL
.ne 1.5i
.SH "Notes"
.PP
This call is not intended to be used by application programs.  The
\*Lsec_acl\*O application programming interface (API) provides all
the functionality necessary to use the ACL facility.  This reference page is
provided for programmers who wish to write an ACL manager.  In order to
write an ACL manager, a programmer must implement the entire \*Lrdacl\*O
interface.
.PP
This network interface is called on the client side via the
\*Lsec_acl\*O local interface.  Developers are responsible for
implementing the server side of this interface.  Test server
code is included as a sample implementation.
.SH "Files"
.VL
.LI \*L/usr/include/dce/rdaclif.idl\*O
The \*Lidl\*O file from which \*Ldce/rdaclif.h\*O was derived.

The following describes a partial list of errors that might be returned.
Refer to the \*(Tg for complete descriptions of all error
messages.
.VL
