.SH "Parameters"
.SS "Input"
.VL
.LI "\*Vbinding\*O"
Specifies the server binding handle for which to set the
authentication and authorization information.
.LI "\*Vserver_princ_name\*O"
Specifies the principal name of the server referenced by
\*Vbinding\*O.  The content of the name and its syntax is
defined by the authentication service in use.
.PP
A client that does not know the server principal name can call the
\*Lrpc_mgmt_inq_server_princ_name(\|)\*O routine to obtain the principal
name of a server that is registered for the required authentication
service.  Using a principal name obtained in this way means that the
client is interested in one-way authentication.  In other words, it
means that the client does not care which server principal received
the remote procedure call request.  The server, though, still verifies
that the client is who the client claims to be.
.LI "\*Vprotect_level\*O"
Specifies the protection level for remote procedure
calls made using \*Vbinding\*O.  The protection level
determines the degree to which authenticated communications
between the client and the server are protected 
by the authentication service specified by \*Vauthn_svc\*O.
.PP
.ne 5
If the RPC runtime or the RPC protocol in the bound protocol sequence
does not support a specified level, the level is
automatically upgraded to the next higher supported level.
The possible protection levels are as follows:
.VL
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_protect_level_default\*O"
Uses the default protection level for the specified
authentication service.
.P
\*Lrpc_c_protect_level_pkt_integ\*O is
the default protection level for the 
DCE shared-secret key authentication service. 
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_protect_level_none\*O"
Performs no authentication:    
tickets 
are not exchanged, session keys are not established, client 
PACs or names are not certified, 
and transmissions are in the clear.  
Note that although uncertified PACs should not be trusted, 
they may be useful for 
debugging, tracing, and measurement purposes.
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_protect_level_connect\*O"
Performs protection only when the client establishes a
relationship with the server.
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_protect_level_call\*O"
Performs protection only at the beginning of each remote procedure
call when the server receives the request.
.PP
This level does not apply to remote procedure calls made over a
connection-based protocol sequence (that is,
\*Lncacn_ip_tcp\*O).  If this level is specified and the binding
handle uses a connection-based protocol sequence,
the routine uses \*Lrpc_c_protect_level_pkt\*O instead.
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_protect_level_pkt\*O"
Ensures that all data received is from the expected client.
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_protect_level_pkt_integ\*O"
Ensures and verifies that none of the data transferred between
client and server has been modified.
.PP
This is the highest protection level that is guaranteed to be
present in the RPC runtime.
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_protect_level_pkt_privacy\*O"
Performs protection as specified by all of the previous levels and
also encrypt each remote procedure call argument value.
.PP
This is the highest protection level, but it may not be
available in the RPC runtime.
.LE
.LI "\*Vauthn_svc\*O"
Specifies the authentication service to use.  
The exact level of protection provided by the 
authentication service is specified by the \*Vprotect_level\*O 
parameter.
The supported
authentication services are as follows:
.VL
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_authn_none\*O"
No authentication:  no tickets 
are exchanged, no session keys established, client PACs or names 
are not transmitted, and transmissions are in the clear.  
Specify \*Lrpc_c_authn_none\*O to turn authentication off for
remote procedure calls made using \*Vbinding\*O. 
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_authn_dce_secret\*O"
DCE shared-secret key authentication.
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_authn_default\*O"
DCE default authentication service.
.nS note
The current default authentication service is DCE 
shared-secret key.  Specifying \*Lrpc_c_authn_default\*O is therefore
equivalent to specifying \*Lrpc_c_authn_dce_secret\*O.
.nE
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_authn_dce_public\*O"
DCE public key authentication (reserved for future use).
.LE
...\" If \*Lrpc_c_authn_default\*O is specified, the RPC runtime uses
...\" the \*Lrpc_c_authn_dce_secret\*O authentication service for
...\" remote procedure calls made using \*Vbinding\*O.
.LI "\*Vauth_identity\*O"
Specifies a handle for the data structure that contains the client's
authentication and authorization credentials appropriate for the
selected authentication and authorization services.
.PP
.ne 1.5i
When using the \*Lrpc_c_authn_dce_secret\*O authentication
service and any authorization service,
this value must be a \*Lsec_login_handle_t\*O obtained
from one of the following routines:
.ad l
.ML
.LI
\*Lsec_login_setup_identity(\|)\*O
.LI
\*Lsec_login_get_current_context(\|)\*O
.LI
\*Lsec_login_newgroups(\|)\*O
.LE
.ad b
.PP
Specify NULL to use the default security login context
for the current address space.
.LI "\*Vauthz_svc\*O"
Specifies the authorization service implemented by the server for the
interface of interest.  The validity and trustworthiness of
authorization data, like any application data, is dependent on the
authentication service and protection level specified.  The
supported authorization services are as follows:
.VL
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_authz_none\*O"
Server performs no authorization.  This is valid only if
the \*Vauthn_svc\*O parameter is \*Lrpc_c_authn_none\*O, specifying that 
no authentication is being performed.
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_authz_name\*O"
Server performs authorization based on the client principal name. 
This value cannot be used if \*Vauthn_svc\*O is
\*Lrpc_c_authn_none\*O.
.LI "\*Lrpc_c_authz_dce\*O"
Server performs authorization using the client's DCE privilege
attribute certificate (PAC) sent to the server with each
remote procedure call made with \*Vbinding\*O.  Generally,
access is checked against DCE access control lists
(ACLs). 
This value cannot be used if \*Vauthn_svc\*O is
\*Lrpc_c_authn_none\*O.
.LE
.LE
.SS "Output"
.VL
.LI "\*Vstatus\*O"

.LE

.ne 1.5i
.SH "Description"
.PP
The \*Lrpc_binding_set_auth_info(\|)\*O routine
sets up the specified server binding handle
so that it can be used to make authenticated remote procedure
calls that include authorization information.
.PP
Unless a client calls \*Lrpc_binding_set_auth_info(\|)\*O with the parameters 
to set establish authentication and authorization methods, 
all remote procedure calls made on
the \*Vbinding\*O binding handle are unauthenticated.  
Some authentication services
(\*Vauthn_svc\*O) may need to communicate with the security service
to perform this operation.  Otherwise, they may receive the
\*Lrpc_s_comm_failure\*O status. 
.PP
The \*Vauthn_svc\*O parameter specifies the authentication service to use.  
Since currently, there is only one available authentication service 
(DCE shared-secret key), the parameter currently functions to specify whether or not 
rpc calls will be authenticated and client PACs certified.  
If authentication is chosen, the \*Vprotect_level\*O parameter can specify 
a variety 
of protection levels, ranging from no authentication 
to the highest level of authentication and encryption. 
If the \*Vprotect_level\*O parameter is set to \*Lrpc_c_protect_level_none\*O, 
no authentication is performed, regardless of the authentication service 
choosen.
.PP
The \*Vauthz_svc\*O parameter specifies the authorization service to use.  
If no authentication has been chosen (\*Vauthn_svc\*O of \*Lrpc_c_authn_none\*O), 
then no authorization (\*Vauthz_svc\*O of \*Lrpc_c_authz_none\*O) must be chosen as well.  
If authentication will be performed, you have two choices for authorization: name-based 
authorization and DCE authorization.  The use of name based_authorization, 
which provides a server with a client's principal name, is not 
recommended.  DCE authorization uses PACs, a trusted mechanism for conveying client 
authorization data to authenticated servers.  PACs are designed to be used with the DCE 
ACL facility.  
.P
Whether the call actually wakes up in the server manager code or is
rejected by the runtime depends on following conditions:
.ML
.LI
If the client specified no authentication, then none is attempted by
the RPC runtime.  The call wakes up in the manager code whether the
server specified authentication or not.  This permits both
authenticated and unauthenticated clients to call authenticated
servers.  When the manager receives an unauthenticated call, it needs
to make a decision about how to proceed.
.LI
If the client specified DCE secret key authentication and the server
specified no authentication, then the runtime will fail the call, and
it will never reach the manager routine.
.LI
If both client and server specified DCE secret key authentication,
then authentication will be carried out by the RPC runtime
transparently.  Whether the call reaches the server manager code or is
rejected by the runtime depends on whether the authentication
succeeded.
.LE
.P
Although the RPC runtime is responsible any authentication that is
carried out, the fact that the runtime will always permit
unauthenticated clients to reach the manager code means that a manager
access function typically does need to make an authentication check.
When the manager access routine calls
\*Lrpc_binding_inq_auth_client(\|)\*O it needs to check for a
\*Vstatus\*O of \*Lrpc_s_binding_has_no_auth\*O.  In this case, the
client has specified no authentication and the manager access function
needs to make an access decision based on this fact.  Note that in such
a case, no meaningful authentication or authorization information is
returned from \*Lrpc_binding_inq_auth_client(\|)\*O.
