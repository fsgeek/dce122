None.

.SS "Output"
.VL
.LI "\*Vencoded_data_buffer\*O"
The address to which the IDL encoding services will write the address of the
buffer that contains the encoded data, when the encoding process
is complete.  When the application no longer needs the buffer,
it should release the memory resource.  See the \*(Dk for an explanation
of how to manage memory when using the IDL encoding services.
.LI "\*Vbuffer_size\*O"
The address to which the IDL encoding services will write
the size of the buffer that contains the encoded data, when
the encoding process is complete.
.LI "\*Ves_handle\*O"
Returns the address of an IDL encoding services handle for use
by a client or server encoding operation.
.LI "\*Vstatus\*O"
Returns the status code from this routine.  This status code indicates
whether the routine completed successfully or, if not, why not.

.SH "Description"
The IDL encoding services provide client and server
RPC applications with a method for encoding data types
in input parameters into a byte stream and decoding data types
in output parameters from a byte stream without invoking
the RPC runtime.  Encoding and decoding operations are
analogous to marshalling and unmarshalling, except that
the data is stored locally, and is not transmitted over
the network.  Client and server applications can use the
IDL encoding services to create persistent storage for
their data.  Encoding flattens complex data types into
a byte stream for storage on disk, while decoding restores
the flattened data to complex form.
.PP
The \*Lidl_es_encode_dyn_buffer(\|)\*O routine belongs
to a set of routines that return handles to the IDL
encoding services for use by client and server encoding
and decoding operations.  The information in the handle
controls the way in which the IDL encoding services
manage memory when encoding or decoding data.
.PP
The \*Lidl_es_encode_dyn_buffer(\|)\*O routine returns a
dynamic buffer encoding handle, which directs the IDL encoding
services to store the encoded data in a chain of small buffers,
build an additional single buffer that contains the encoded
data, and pass that buffer's address to the application.
Dynamic buffering is the most expensive style of IDL
encoding services buffering, since two copies of the encoded
data exist (one in the chain of buffers, and one in
the single buffer).
