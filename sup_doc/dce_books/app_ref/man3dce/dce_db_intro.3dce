.SH "Name"
\*Ldce_db_intro\*O - Introduction to the DCE backing store interface
.SH "Description"
The DCE backing store interface allows you to maintain typed data 
between program invocations.  For example, you might store 
application-specific configuration data in a backing store, and 
then retrieve it from the backing store when the application 
restarts.  The backing store routines can be used in servers, in
clients or in standalone programs that do not involve remote procedure
calls (RPCs).  A program can have more than one backing store open 
at the same time.
.PP
Sometimes the backing store is called a database.  For instance, the
associated IDL file is \*Ldce/database.idl\*O, and the name of the
backing store routines begin with \*Ldce_db_\*O.  The backing store
is, however, not a full-fledged database in the conventional sense,
and it has no support for SQL or for any other query system.
.SS "Backing Store Data"
.PP
The backing store interface provides for the tagged storage and 
retrieval of typed data.  The tag (or retrieval key) can be either 
a UUID or a standard C string.  For a specific backing store, the 
data type must be specified at compile time, and is established 
through the IDL encoding services.  Each backing store can contain 
only a single data type.
.P
Each data item (also called a data object or data record)
consists of the data stored by a single call to a storage routine 
(\*Ldce_db_store(\|)\*O, \*Ldce_db_store_by_name(\|)\*O, or 
\*Ldce_db_store_by_uuid(\|)\*O).  Optionally, data items can 
have headers.  If a backing store has been
created to use headers, then every data item must have a header. 
For a description of the data item header, see the section
in this reference page entitled \*LData Types and Structures\*O.
.SS "Encoding and Decoding in the Backing Store"
.P
When an RPC sends data between a client and a server, it
serializes the user's data structures by using the IDL encoding
services (ES), described in the \*(Dg.
.P
The backing store uses this same serialization scheme for
encoding and decoding, informally called \*Epickling\*O, when storing data
structures to disk.  The IDL compiler, \*Lidl\*O, writes the routine
that encodes and decodes the data.  
.PP
.ne 7
This routine is passed to
\*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O, remembered in the handle, and used by the store
and fetch routines:

\*Ldce_db_fetch_by_name(\|)\*O

.LI
\*Ldce_db_store_by_name(\|)\*O
.LI
\*Ldce_db_store_by_uuid(\|)\*O
.LE
.ad b
.SS "Memory Allocation"
.P
When fetching data, the encoding services allocate memory for the
data structures that are returned.  These services accept a structure,
and use \*Lrpc_sm_allocate(\|)\*O to provide additional memory needed
to hold the data.
.P
The backing store library does not know what memory has been allocated, and
therefore cannot free it.  For fetch calls that are made from a server
stub, this is not a problem, since the memory is freed automatically
when the server call terminates.  For fetch calls that are made from a
nonserver, the programmer is responsible for freeing the memory.
.P
Programs that call the fetch or store routines, such as \*Ldce_db_fetch(\|)\*O,
outside of a server operation (for instance, if a server does some
backing store initialization, or in a standalone program) must call
\*Lrpc_sm_enable_allocate(\|)\*O first.
.SS "The Backing Store Routines"
.P
Many of the backing store routines appear in three versions: plain, by
name, and by UUID.  The plain version will work with backing
stores that were created to be indexed either by name, or by UUID,
while the restricted versions accept only the matching type.  It is
advantageous to use the restricted versions when they are appropriate,
because they provide type checking by the compiler, as well as
visual clarity of purpose.
.P
The backing store routines are as follows, listed in alphabetical order:
.P
.VL
.LI "\*Ldce_db_close(\|)\*O"
Frees the handle returned by \*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O.  It closes any
open files and releases all other resources associated with the
backing store.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_delete(\|)\*O"
Deletes an item from a backing store that is indexed by
name or by UUID.  The key's type must match the flag that was used in
\*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_delete_by_name(\|)\*O"
Deletes an item only from a backing store that is indexed by
name.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_delete_by_uuid(\|)\*O"
Deletes an item only from a backing store that is indexed by
UUID.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_fetch(\|)\*O"
Retrieves data from a backing store that is indexed by
name or by UUID.  The key's type must match the flag that was used in
\*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_fetch_by_name(\|)\*O"
Retrieves data only from a backing store that is indexed 
by name.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_fetch_by_uuid(\|)\*O"
Retrieves data only from a backing store that is indexed 
by UUID.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_free(\|)\*O"
Releases the data supplied from a backing store.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_header_fetch(\|)\*O
Retrieves a header from a backing store.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_inq_count(\|)\*O"
Returns the number of items in a backing store.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_iter_done(\|)\*O"
Terminates and iteration operation initiated by \*Ldce_\%db_\%iter_\%start(\|)\*O.  
It should be called when iteration is done.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_iter_next(\|)\*O"
Returns the key for the next item from a backing store
that is indexed by name or by UUID.  The \*Ldb_s_no_more\*O return 
value indicates that there are no more items.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_iter_next_by_name(\|)\*O"
Returns the key for the next item only from a backing store
that is indexed by name.  The \*Ldb_s_no_more\*O return 
value indicates that there are no more items.
.nL
.ne 6
.LI "\*Ldce_db_iter_next_by_uuid(\|)\*O"
Returns the key for the next item only from a backing store
that is indexed by UUID.  The \*Ldb_s_no_more\*O return 
value indicates that there are no more items.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_iter_start(\|)\*O"
Prepares for the start of iteration.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_lock(\|)\*O"
Locks a backing store.  A lock is associated
with an open backing store's handle.  The storage routines,
\*Ldce_db_store(\|)\*O, \*Ldce_db_store_by_name(\|)\*O, and
\*Ldce_db_store_by_uuid(\|)\*O, all acquire the lock before updating.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O"
Creates a new backing store or opens an existing one.  The 
backing store is identified by a filename.  Flags allow you to
.ad l
.ML
.LI
Create a new backing store, or open an existing one.
.LI
Create a new backing store indexed by name, or indexed by UUID.
.LI
Open an existing backing store read/write, or read-only.
.LI
Use the standard data item header, or not.
.LE
.ad b
.P
The routine returns a handle by which subsequent routines can reference 
the opened backing store.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_std_header_init(\|)\*O
Initializes a standard backing store header retrieved by 
\*Ldce_db_header_fetch(\|)\*O.  It only places the values 
into the header, and does not write into the backing store.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_store(\|)\*O"
Stores a data item into a backing store that is indexed by name or
by UUID.  The key's type must match the flag that was used in
\*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_store_by_name(\|)\*O"
Stores a data item only into a backing store that is indexed 
by name.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_store_by_uuid(\|)\*O"
Stores a data item only into a backing store that is indexed 
by UUID.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_unlock(\|)\*O"
Unlocks a backing store.
.LE
.SS "Data Types and Structures"
.P
.VL
.LI "\*Ldce_db_handle_t\*O"
An opaque handle to a backing store.  Use \*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O 
to acquire the handle.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_header_t\*O"
The data structure that defines a standard backing 
store header for data items.  Use \*Ldce_db_header_fetch(\|)\*O to 
retrieve it from a backing store and \*Ldce_db_std_header_init(\|)\*O
to initialize it.
.LI "\*Ldce_db_convert_func_t\*O"
An opaque pointer to the data conversion function to be used when 
storing or retrieving data.  This function is specified as an argument 
to \*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O at open time.  It converts between native format 
and on-disk (serialized) format.  It is generated from the IDL file 
by the IDL compiler.
.LE
.SH "Cautions"
You can not use conformant arrays in objects stored to a backing store.
This is because the idl-generated code that encodes (pickles) the structure
has no way to predict or detect the size of the array.  When the
object is fetched, there will likely be insufficient space provided
for the structure, and the array's data will destroy whatever is
in memory after the structure.
