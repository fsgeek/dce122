.SH "Parameters"
.SS "Input"
.VL
.LI "\*Vhandle\*O"
A handle, returned from \*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O, that identifies the
backing store being used.
.LI "\*Vkey\*O"
A UUID that is the backing store key.
.LI "\*Vdata\*O"
A pointer to the data structure to be stored.
.LE
.SS "Output"
.VL
.LI "\*Vstatus\*O"
A pointer to the completion status.  On successful completion, the
routine returns \*Lerror_status_ok\*O.  Otherwise, it returns an error.
.LE
.SH "Description"
The \*Ldce_db_store_by_uuid(\|)\*O routine  stores the data structure pointed
to by \*Vdata\*O into the backing store.  The conversion function that
was specified in the call to \*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O serializes the
structure so that it can be written to disk.
.PP
This routine is specialized for storage into backing stores that are
indexed by UUID, as selected by the \*Ldb_c_index_by_uuid\*O bit in
the \*Vflags\*O parameter to \*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O when the backing
store was created.
.PP
.ne 7
If the \*Vkey\*O value is the same as a key already stored, the new
\*Vdata\*O replaces the previously stored data associated with that key.
.SH "Notes"
Because the \*Ldce_db_store_by_uuid(\|)\*O routine uses the encoding services,
and they in turn use \*Lrpc_sm_allocate(\|)\*O, all programs that call
\*Ldce_db_store_by_uuid(\|)\*O outside of a server operation (for instance, if
a server does some backing store initialization, or in a standalone
program) must call \*Lrpc_sm_enable_allocate(\|)\*O first.  Indeed,
every thread that calls \*Ldce_db_store_by_uuid(\|)\*O must do
\*Lrpc_sm_enable_allocate(\|)\*O, but in the server side of an RPC,
this is already done.

.SH "Errors"
.PP
The following describes a partial list of errors that might be returned.
Refer to the \*(Tg for complete descriptions of all error
messages.
.VL
.LI "\*Ldb_s_bad_index_type\*O"
The backing store is not indexed by UUID.
.LI "\*Ldb_s_readonly\*O"
The backing store was opened with the \*Ldb_c_readonly\*O flag, and
cannot be written to.
.LI "\*Ldb_s_store_failed\*O"
The data could not be stored into the backing store for some reason.
The global variable \*Lerrno\*O may contain more information about the
error.
.LI "\*Ldb_s_iter_not_allowed\*O"
The function was called while an iteration, begun by
\*Ldce_db_iter_start(\|)\*O, was in progress.  Storing is not allowed
during iteration.
.LI "\*Lerror_status_ok\*O"
The call was successful.
.LE
