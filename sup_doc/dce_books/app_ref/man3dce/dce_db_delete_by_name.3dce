.VL
.LI "\*Vhandle\*O"
A handle, returned from \*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O, that identifies the
backing store being used.
.LI "\*Vkey\*O"
A NULL-terminated string that is the key to the item in the backing store.
.LE

.LI "\*Vstatus\*O"
A pointer to the completion status.  On successful completion, the
routine returns \*Lerror_status_ok\*O.  Otherwise, it returns an error code.

.SH "Description"
The \*Ldce_db_delete_by_name(\|)\*O routine deletes an item from the
backing store that is identified by the \*Vhandle\*O parameter,
which was obtained from \*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O.  It is a specialized
deletion routine for backing stores that are indexed by name, as selected by
the \*Ldb_c_index_by_name\*O bit in the \*Vflags\*O parameter to
\*Ldce_db_open(\|)\*O when the backing store was created.

The following describes a partial list of errors that might be returned.
Refer to the \*(Tg for complete descriptions of all error
messages.
.VL
.LI "\*Ldb_s_del_failed\*O"
The deletion did not occur.  The global variable \*Lerrno\*O may
indicate further information about the error.
.LI "\*Ldb_s_bad_index_type\*O"
The backing store is not indexed by name.
.LI "\*Ldb_s_iter_not_allowed\*O"
The function was called while an iteration, begun by
\*Ldce_db_iter_start(\|)\*O, was in progress.  Deletion is not allowed
during iteration.
.LI "\*Lerror_status_ok\*O"
The call was successful.
