.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
.sS
\*Lcdscp show clerk\*O 
.sE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \*Lshow clerk\*O command displays all the names and values of the clerk  
attributes on the local system.  The clerk must be enabled when you use 
this command.  The following are valid attributes:
.iX "clerk entity"
.VL
.LI "\*LAuthentication Failures\*O"
Specifies the number of times a requesting principal failed
authentication procedures.
.LI "\*LCache Bypasses\*O"
Specifies the number of requests to read attributes for
which the clerk was specifically directed by the requesting application to
bypass its own cache.  Instead, a server is contacted to get the requested
information.  This attribute does not account for requests that 
the clerk is unable to satisfy from the cache or for requests
to look up names or enumerate the contents of directories.
.LI "\*LCache Hits\*O"
Specifies the total number of read requests directed to this clerk
that were satisfied entirely by the information contained in its own cache.
This attribute accounts only for requests to read attribute values and does not
include requests to look up names or enumerate the contents of directories.
.LI "\*LCreation Time\*O"
Specifies the time when this entity was created.
.LI "\*LMiscellaneous Operations\*O"
Specifies the number of operations other than read and write (that is, 
skulks, enumerating contents of directories, and so on) performed by this clerk.
.LI "\*LRead Operations\*O"
Specifies the number of lookup operations performed by this
clerk.  This attribute accounts only for requests to read attributes and does
not include requests to look up names or enumerate the contents of directories.
.LI "\*LWrite Operations\*O"
Specifies how many requests to modify data were processed by this
clerk.
.LE
.SS "Privileges Required"
.PP
You must have \*Lr\*O (\*Lread\*O) permission to the clerk.
