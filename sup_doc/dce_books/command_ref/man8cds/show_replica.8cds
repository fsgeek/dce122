\*Lshow replica\*O - Displays attribute information about the specified replica
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP

\*Lcdscp show replica\*O \*Vdirectory-name\*O \*Lclearinghouse\*O \*Vclearinghouse-name\*O
.nL
[\*Vattribute-name\*O]
.sE
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.VL
.LI "\*Vdirectory-name\*O"
The full name of the directory
.LI "\*Lclearinghouse\*O \*Vclearinghouse-name\*O"
The full name of the clearinghouse
.LI "\*Vattribute-name\*O"
The name of a particular attribute; see 
\*LDESCRIPTION\*O for valid attribute names.
.LE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \*Lshow replica\*O command displays the directory-specific attributes 
as well as the per-replica attributes of the specified directory.  If you do 
not supply any attributes, the command displays all attributes and their
values; any application-defined attributes that might exist will be
included in the output of this command.  You can enter one or more 
of the following attributes:
.VL
.LI "\*LCDS_AllUpTo\*O"
Indicates the date and time of the last successful skulk on the directory.
All replicas of the directory are guaranteed to have received all updates
whose timestamps are less than the value of this attribute.
.LI "\*LCDS_Convergence\*O"
Specifies the degree of consistency among replicas.  This attribute's 
value is defined as one of the following:
.VL
.LI "\*Llow\*O"
CDS does not immediately propagate an update.  The
next skulk distributes all updates that occurred since the previous skulk.
Skulks occur at least once every 24 hours.
.LI "\*Lmedium\*O"
CDS attempts to immediately propagate an
update to all replicas.  If the attempt fails, the next scheduled skulk makes
the replicas consistent.  Skulks occur at least once every 12 hours.
.LI "\*Lhigh\*O"
CDS attempts to immediately propagate an update
to all replicas.  If the attempt fails (for example, if one of the replicas
is unavailable), a skulk is scheduled for within one hour.  Skulks usually
occur at least once every 12 hours.  Use this setting temporarily and
briefly, because it uses extensive system resources.
.LE
.PP
By default, every directory inherits the convergence setting of its parent
at creation time.  The default setting on the root directory is
\*Lmedium\*O.
.LI "\*LCDS_CTS\*O"
Specifies the creation timestamp (CTS) of the directory of which this 
replica is a copy.
.LI "\*LCDS_DirectoryVersion\*O"
Specifies the minimum of all the values of the \*LCDS_ReplicaVersion\*O 
attribute on the directory replicas.
.LI "\*LCDS_Epoch\*O"
A Universal Unique Identifier 
(UUID) that identifies a particular incarnation of the directory.
.LI "\*LCDS_LastSkulk\*O"
Records the timestamp of the last skulk performed on this particular 
replica of a directory.
.LI "\*LCDS_LastUpdate\*O"
Records the timestamp of the last update to any attribute of the
replica, or any change to the contents of the replica, including 
object entries, child pointers, and soft links.
.LI "\*LCDS_ObjectUUID\*O"
Specifies the unique identifier of the directory of 
which this replica is a copy.
.LI "\*LCDS_ParentPointer\*O"
Contains a pointer to this directory's parent in the namespace.
.nL
.ne 5
.LI "\*LCDS_Replicas\*O"
Specifies the address, UUID, and name of every clearinghouse where a replica
of this directory is located.  This attribute also specifies whether the
replica in a particular clearinghouse is a master or read-only replica.
.LI "\*LCDS_ReplicaState\*O"
Specifies the internal state of a replica.  When you create or
delete a replica, it goes through various states.
.LI "\*LCDS_ReplicaType\*O"
Specifies the replica type of a directory.
.LI "\*LCDS_ReplicaVersion\*O"
Specifies the replica version of a directory.
.LI "\*LCDS_RingPointer\*O"
Specifies the UUID of a clearinghouse containing another
replica of this directory.  This attribute is written by the
system and is read-only to users.  It will appear on older directories,
but \*Enot\*O on DCE 1.1 directories.
.LI "\*LCDS_UTS\*O"
Specifies the timestamp of the most recent update to an attribute of the
directory.
.LI "\*LRPC_ClassVersion\*O"
Specifies the RPC runtime software version that can be used to
import on the directory.
.LE
.SS "Privileges Required"
.PP
You must have \*Lr\*O (\*Lread\*O) permission to the 
directory from which the replica is created.  
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
This command is replaced at DCE Version 1.1 by the \*Ldcecp\*O 
command and may not be provided in future releases of DCE.
