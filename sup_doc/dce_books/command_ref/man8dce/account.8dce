.VL 
.LI "\*Vaccount_name\*O" 
A list of one or more names of accounts to act on. 
Note that accounts are identified by  
principal names, so when you create an account you supply a principal name  
for the account name.    
.PP  
Supply the names as follows: 
.ML 
.LI 
Fully qualified account names in the form 
\*L/.../\*Vcell_name\*L/\*Vaccount_name\*O or \*L/.:/\*Vaccount_name\*O 
.LI 
Cell-relative account names in the form \*Vaccount_name\*O.   
These names refer to an account in the cell identified in the 
\*L_s(sec)\*O convenience variable, or if the \*L_s(sec)\*O convenience variable is not set,  
in the local host's default cell. 
.LE 
.PP 
Do not mix fully qualified names and cell-relative names in a list.   
In addition, do not use the names of registry database objects that contain  
account information; in other words, do not use account names that begin with 
\*L/.:/sec/account/\*O. 
.LI "\*Vaccount_name_list\*O" 
The name of a single account to act on. 
See \*Vaccount_name_list\*O for the name format.
.zA "def,13377,R1.2.2,add cell_name"
.LI "\*Vcell_name\*O" 
The name of a specific cell (or \*L/.:\*O for the local cell) in which to catalog  
accounts.
.zZ "def,13377,R1.2.2,add cell_name" 
.LI "\*Voperation\*O" 
The name of the \*Laccount\*O operation for which to display help information. 
.LE 
.zZ "def,13377,R1.2.2,clarify syntax"
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
The \*Laccount\*O object represents registry accounts.  Although an account is 
associated with one principal, one group, and one organization, it is  
identified by the principal's primary name.  Alias names are differentiated 
for principals, so one principal can have multiple accounts under different 
alias names.   
.P 
When this command executes, it attempts to bind to the registry server  
identified in the \*L_s(sec)\*O variable.    
If that server cannot process the request or if the \*L_s(sec)\*O 
variable is not set, the command binds  
to either an available slave server or the master registry server,  
depending on the operation.   
Upon completion, the command sets the \*L_b(sec)\*O convenience variable 
to the name of the registry server it bound to. 
.SH "ATTRIBUTES" 
.PP 
The \*Laccount\*O object supports the following two kinds of attributes: 
.ML 
.LI 
Account attributes may or may not have default values.  They 
assume a default value or a value set by administrators.   
.LI 
Policy 
attributes regulate such things as account and password lifetimes for 
all accounts associated with a particular registry.  Policy 
attributes have registry wide default values.  They always 
assume the most restrictive value whether it is the registry wide 
default value or a value set for an individual account.  
.zA "def,13592,R1.2.2,add public key"
.LI
Public Key attributes regulate the creation and modification of public key 
pairs used for public key authentication.
.zZ "def,13592,R1.2.2,add public key"
.LE 
.PP 
.SS "Account Attributes" 
...\""The account attributes are as follows: 
.VL 
.LI "\*Lacctvalid \*O{\*Lyes \*O| \*Lno\*O}"  
A flag set to determine account validity.  Its value is either 
\*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  An account with an \*Lacctvalid\*O 
attribute set to \*Lno\*O is invalid and cannot be logged in to.  The 
default is \*Lyes\*O. 
.LI "\*Lclient \*O{\*Lyes \*L| no\*O}"  
A flag set to indicate whether the account is for a principal that 
can act as a client.  Its value is either \*Lyes\*O or 
\*Lno\*O.  If you set this flag to \*Lyes\*O, the principal is able 
to log in to the account and acquire tickets for authentication.  The 
default is \*Lyes\*O. 
.LI "\*Lcreated \*Vcreators_name ISO_timestamp\*O" 
A list of two items.  The first is the principal name of the creator of the 
account, the second is an ISO timestamp showing the time of creation.  This 
attribute is set by the system at the time of account creation and cannot be 
specified or modified. 
.LI "\*Ldescription \*V\"text string\"\*O" 
A text string (limited to the Portable Character Set)  
typically used to describe the use of the account.  The default is the empty string (""). 
.LI "\*Ldupkey \*O{\*Lyes \*O| \*Lno\*O}"  
A flag set to determine whether tickets issued to the account's principal can 
have duplicate keys.  Its value is either \*Lyes\*O or 
\*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lno\*O. 
.PP 
In DCE this attribute is currently only advisory.  However, Kerberos clients and servers 
make use of it when they interact with a DCE Security server.  
.LI "\*Lexpdate  \*VISO_timestamp\*O" 
The date on which the account expires.  To renew the account, change 
the date in this field.  To specify the time, use an ISO-compliant time 
format such as \*VCCYY-MM-DD-hh:mm:ss\*O or the string \*Lnone\*O. 
The default is \*Lnone\*O. 
.LI "\*Lforwardabletkt \*O{\*Lyes \*O| \*Lno\*O}"  
A flag set to determine whether a new ticket-granting ticket with a network 
address that differs from the present ticket-granting ticket's network 
address can be issued to the account's principal.  The 
\*Lproxiabletkt\*O attribute performs the same function for service 
tickets.  Its value is either \*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  The
default is \*Lyes\*O. 
.PP 
In DCE this attribute is currently only advisory.  However, Kerberos clients and servers  
make use of it when they interact with a DCE Security server.  
.LI "\*Lgoodsince \*VISO_timestamp\*O" 
The date and time the account was last known to be in an uncompromised 
state.  Any tickets granted before this date are invalid.  The value is an 
ISO timestamp.  When the account is initially created, the 
\*Lgoodsince\*O date is set to the current date. 
Control over this date is especially useful if you know that an account's 
password was compromised.  Changing the password can prevent the 
unauthorized principal from accessing the system again using that password, 
but the changed password does not prevent the principal from accessing the 
system components 
for which tickets were obtained fraudulently before the password was 
changed.  To eliminate the principal's access to the system, the tickets 
must be canceled. 
.PP 
The default is the time the account was created. 
.LI "\*Lgroup \*Vgroup_name\*O" 
The name of the group associated with the account.  The value is a single 
group name of an existing group in the registry.  This attribute must be specified for the  
\*Laccount create\*O command; it does not have a 
default value.   
.PP 
If a group is deleted 
from the registry, all accounts associated with the group are also deleted. 
.LI "\*Lhome \*Vdirectory_name\*O" 
The file system directory in which the principal is placed at login.   
The default is the \*L/\*O directory. 
.LI "\*Llastchange \*Vprincipal_name ISO_timestamp\*O" 
A list of two items.  The first is the principal name of the last modifier 
of the account; the second is an ISO timestamp showing the time of the last 
modification.  This attribute is set by the system whenever the  
account is modified; it cannot be set or modified directly.  The  
initial value consists of the principal name of the creator of the account   
and the time the account was created.  
.LI "\*Lorganization \*Vorganization_name\*O" 
The name of the organization associated with the account.  The value is a 
single organization name of an existing organization in the registry.  This 
attribute must be specified for the \*Laccount create\*O command; it does 
not have a default value.   
.PP 
If an organization is deleted from the 
registry, all accounts associated with the organization are deleted also. 
.LI "\*Lpassword \*Vpassword\*O" 
The password of the account. 
This attribute must be specified 
for the \*Laccount create\*O command; there is no default value. This attribute is not 
returned by an \*Laccount show\*O command. 
.LI "\*Lpostdatedtkt \*O{\*Lyes\*O | \*Lno\*O}"  
A flag set to determine if tickets with a start time some time in the 
future can be issued to the account's principal. Its value is either 
\*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lno\*O. 
.PP 
In DCE, this attribute is currently only advisory.  However, Kerberos clients and servers  
make use of it when they interact with a DCE Security server.  
.LI "\*Lproxiabletkt {yes | no}\*O"  
A flag set to determine whether a new ticket with a different 
network address than the present ticket can be issued to the account's 
principal.  The \*Lforwardabletkt\*O attribute performs the same 
function for ticket-granting tickets.  Its value is either 
\*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lno\*O. 
.PP 
In DCE, this attribute is currently only advisory.  However, Kerberos clients and servers  
make use of it when they interact with a DCE Security server.  
.LI "\*Lpwdvalid \*O{\*Lyes\*O | \*Lno\*O}"  
A flag set to determine whether the current password is valid.  If this 
flag is set to \*Lno\*O, the next time a principal logs in to the 
account, the system prompts the principal to change the password.  (Note 
that this flag is separate from the \*Lpwdexpdate\*O policy, which sets 
time limits on password validity.)  Its value is either 
\*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lyes\*O. 
.LI "\*Lrenewabletkt {yes | no}\*O"  
A flag set to determine if the ticket-granting ticket issued to the 
account's principal can be renewed.  If this flag is set to \*Lyes\*O, 
the authentication service renews the ticket-granting ticket if its 
lifetime is valid.  Its value is either \*Lyes\*O or 
\*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lyes\*O. 
.PP 
In DCE this attribute is currently only advisory.  However, Kerberos clients and servers  
make use of it when they interact with a DCE Security server. 
.LI "\*Lserver \*O{\*Lyes \*O| \*Lno\*O}"  
A flag set to indicate whether the account is for a principal that 
can act as a server.  Its value is either 
\*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  This flag should be \*Lyes\*O for any 
server that engages in authenticated communications.  
The default is \*Lyes\*O. 
.LI "\*Lshell \*Vpath_to_shell\*O"  
The path of the shell that is executed when a principal logs in.   
The legal value is any shell supported by the home cell.  The default value is  
the empty string (""). 
.LI "\*Lstdtgtauth {yes | no}\*O"  
A flag set to determine whether service tickets issued to the 
account's principal use the standard DCE ticket-granting ticket 
authentication mechanism.  Its value is either \*Lyes\*O or 
\*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lyes\*O. 
.zA "def,13530,R1.2.2,Add usertouser attribute"
.LI "\*Lusertouser {yes | no}\*O"  
For server principals, a flag set to determine whether the server must 
use user-to-user authentication. Its value is either \*Lyes\*O 
(must use user-to-user authentication) or 
\*Lno\*O (uses server-key-based authentication).  
The default is \*Lno\*O. 
.zZ "def,13530,R1.2.2,Add usertouser attribute"
.LE 
.SS "Policy Attributes" 
...\" The policy attributes are as follows: 
.VL 
.LI "\*Lmaxtktlife \*Vrelative_time\*O" 
The maximum amount of time that a ticket can be valid.  To specify the 
time, use the Distributed Time Service (DTS) relative time format  
([\*L-\*O]\*VDD\*L-\*Vhh\*L:\*Vmm\*L:\*Vss\*O). 
When a client requests a ticket to a server, the lifetime granted to the 
ticket takes into account the \*Lmaxtktlife\*O set for both the server  
and the client.  In other words, the lifetime cannot exceed the 
shorter of the server's or client's \*Lmaxtktlife\*O.  If you do not 
specify a \*Lmaxtktlife\*O for an account, the \*Lmaxtktlife\*O 
defined as registry authorization policy is used. 
.LI "\*Lmaxtktrenew \*Vrelative_time\*O" 
The amount of time before a principal's ticket-granting ticket expires 
and that principal must log in to the system again to reauthenticate 
and obtain another ticket-granting ticket.  To specify the time, use 
the DTS relative time format 
([\*L-\*O]\*VDD\*L-\*Vhh\*L:\*Vmm\*L:\*Vss\*O).  The lifetime of the 
principal's service tickets can never exceed the lifetime of the 
principal's ticket-granting ticket.  The shorter you make \*Lmaxtktrenew\*O, the 
greater the security of the system.  However, since principals must log 
in again to renew their ticket-granting ticket, the time specified needs 
to balance user convenience against the level of security required. 
If you do not specify this for an account, the \*Lmaxtktrenew\*O 
lifetime defined as registry authorization policy is used. 
.PP
.zA "def,13499,R1.2.2,add not used"

this option is unsupported at the present time.

.SS "Public Key Attributes" 
.VL 
.LI "\*Lpkgenprivkey {\*Vinteger \*L| default}"
Updates the public key pair used by the security server for 
public key authentication. Used only with the \*Lmodify\*O operation and 
only for the principal named \*Lkrbtgt/\*Vcellname\*O. 
The \*Vinteger\*O argument defines the bit length of the key modulus.  It can be a value of 
\*L0\*O or a number from 256 through 1024 inclusive.  A \*L0\*O indicates 
that no key pair will be generated.  The default for \*Vinteger\*O is \*L0\*O.   
.PP
The \*Ldefault\*O argument indicates that the public key default for the key modulus 
should be used.
.PP  
.LI "\*Lpkkeycipherusage \*Vpk_attributes\*O
Generates or modifies information 
used to encrypt public key pairs.  
Used with the \*Lcreate\*O and \*Lmodify\*O operations, this attribute 
allows you to generate new key pairs, update existing key pairs, and change the 
public key password.  
The \*Vpk_attributes\*O listed below define the tasks to perform and 
supply the information needed to perform the tasks.
.VL
.LI "\*Lgeneratekey {\*Vinteger \*L| default}\*O"
Randomly generate a new public key pair to use for encryption.  
The randomly generated key pair will create a new pair if 
none exists for the account or update the existing pair.    
If you supply this 
attribute, you cannot supply the \*Lpublickeyfile\*O and 
\*Lprivatekeyfile\*O attributes.
The \*Vinteger\*O argument defines the bit length of the key modulus.  It can be a value of 
\*L0\*O or a number from 256 through 1024 inclusive.  A \*L0\*O indicates 
that no key pair will be generated.  The default for \*Vinteger\*O is \*L0\*O.
