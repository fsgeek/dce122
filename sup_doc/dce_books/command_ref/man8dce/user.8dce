The name of the \*Luser\*O operation for which to display help information.  
.LI "\*Vuser_name_list\*O" 
A list of one or more names of principals to act on. Supply the names as follows: 
.ML 
.LI 
Fully qualified principal names in the form
.iS  
\*L/.../\*Vcell_name\*L/\*Vprincipal_name\*O or \*L/.:/\*Vprincipal_name\*O

in the local host's default cell. 
.LE 
.PP 
Do not mix fully qualified names and cell-relative names in a list.   
In addition, do not use the names of registry database objects that contain  
principal information; in other words, do not use names that begin with 
\*L/.:/sec/principal/\*O. 
.LE  
.SH "DESCRIPTION"  
.PP  
The \*Luser\*O task object represents all of the data associated with a DCE  
user.  This consists of registry information and a Cell Directory  
Service (CDS) directory in the  
default implementation.  The \*Luser\*O task object allows 
administrators to easily create principals and accounts, delete principals and accounts, 
and view principal information.  
.PP  
When it creates a principal and account, the \*Luser\*O task object 
adds a CDS directory named after the principal with the  
appropriate access control list (ACL).
If necessary the \*Luser\*O task object also 
adds the principal to a group and an organization, creating the group and 
organization if necessary.  Only the principal and account   
attributes are considered attributes of the \*Luser\*O task object, and are   
the only ones displayed by the \*Lshow\*O operation.  
.PP  
This object is implemented as a script to allow it to be manipulated  
and extended on a per-site basis.  For example, administrators might  
want to add Global Directory Service (GDS) and Distributed File Service  
(DFS) information to the object.  Other possible  
modifications include the following:  
.ML  
.LI  
Changing the location of the CDS directory created for users,  
or remove it completely.  
.LI  
Changing the default ACLs placed on the various objects.  
.LI  
Setting certain attributes or policies on all newly created  
principals and accounts to match the site's policies.  
.LI  
Setting up site specific defaults for passwords (to be changed  
by the user later), groups, organizations, principal  
directories, and so on.  
.LI  
Supporting a \*Lmodify\*O operation.  
.LE  
.SH "ATTRIBUTES"  
.VL  
.LI "\*Lalias \*Vvalue\*O"   
Used with the \*Lcreate\*O operation.   
The value of this attribute must be \*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  Each  
principal can have only one name, but may have one or more alias names.  
All these names refer to the same principal and, therefore, the same   
Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) and UNIX ID (uid).    
While aliases refer to the same principal, they are separate  
entries in the registry database.  Therefore the name supplied to a  
\*Luser\*O command can refer to either the primary name or an  
alias name of a principal.  The value of this attribute determines  
whether the name is a primary name (\*Lalias no\*O) or an alias name  
(\*Lalias yes\*O).  The default is \*Lno\*O.   
.LI "\*Lclient \*O{\*Lyes\*O | \*Lno\*O}"   
A flag set to indicate whether the account is for a principal that  
can act as a client.  The value of this attribute must be \*Lyes\*O or  
\*Lno\*O.  If you set it to \*Lyes\*O, the principal is able  
to log in to the account and acquire tickets for authentication.  The  
default is \*Lyes\*O.  
.LI "\*Ldescription \"\*Vtext string\*L\""  
A text string (limited to the Portable Character Set or PCS)   
typically used to describe the use of the account. The default is  
the empty string (""). 
.LI "\*Ldupkey \*O{\*Lyes \*O| \*Lno\*O}"   
A flag set to determine if tickets issued to the account's principal can 
have duplicate keys.  The value of this attribute must be \*Lyes\*O or 
\*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lno\*O. 
.zA "def,13377,R1.2.2,add that attr is advisory" 
.PP 
In DCE, this attribute is currently only advisory.  However, Kerberos clients and servers  
will use of it when they interact with a DCE Security server.  
.zZ "def,13377,R1.2.2,attr that is advisory" 
.LI "\*Lexpdate  \*VISO_timestamp\*O"  
The date on which the account expires.  To renew the account, change  
the date in this field.  Specify the time by using an ISO compliant time  
format such as \*VCCYY\*L-\*VMM\*L-\*VDD\*L-\*Vhh\*L:\*Vmm\*L:\*Vss\*O   
or the string \*Lnone\*O.  The default is \*Lnone\*O.  
.LI "\*Lforwardabletkt \*O{\*Lyes\*O |\*L no\*O}"  
A flag set to determine whether a new ticket-granting ticket with a network 
address that differs from the present ticket-granting ticket network 
address can be issued to the account's principal.  The 
\*Lproxiabletkt\*O attribute performs the same function for service tickets.  
This attribute must have a value of \*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lyes\*O. 
.zA "def,13377,R1.2.2,add that attr is advisory" 
.PP 
In DCE, this attribute is currently only advisory.  However, Kerberos clients and servers  
will use it when they interact with a DCE Security server.  
.zZ "def,13377,R1.2.2,attr that is advisory" 
.LI "\*Lfullname \*Vstring\*O"  
Used with the \*Lcreate\*O operation, this attribute specifies the full name of  
the principal.  It is for information purposes only.  It typically  
describes or expands a primary name to allow easy recognition by  
users.  For example, a principal could have a primary name of  
\*Ljsbach\*O and a full name of \*LJohann S. Bach\*O.  The value is a  
string.  If it contains spaces, it is displayed in quotes, and on entry  
must be in quotations or braces (as per Tcl quoting rules).  If  
not entered, the full name defaults to the null string (that is,  
blank).  
.LI "\*Lforce\*O"  
Force creation of the specified group or organization if they do not exist.  
.LI "\*Lgroup \*Vgroup_name\*O"  
The name of the group associated with the account.  The value is a single 
group name of an existing group in the registry.  This attribute must be specified for the  
\*Luser create\*O command; it does not have a 
default value.   
.PP 
If a group is deleted 
from the registry, all accounts associated with the group are also deleted. 
.LI "\*Lhome \*Vdirectory_name\*O"  
The file system directory in which the principal is placed in at login.  
The default is the \*L/\*O directory. 
.LI "\*Lorganization \*Vorganization_name\*O"  
The name of the organization associated with the account.  The value is a 
single organization name of an existing organization in the registry.  This 
attribute must be specified for the \*Laccount create\*O command; it does 
not have a default value.   
.PP 
If an organization is deleted from the 
registry, all accounts associated with the organization are also deleted. 
.LI "\*Lmaxtktlife \*Vrelative_time\*O"  
The maximum amount of time that a ticket can be valid.  Specify the  
time by using the Distributed Time Service (DTS)  
relative time format   
(\*L[-]\*VDD\*L-\*Vhh\*L:\*Vmm\*L:\*Vss\*O).  When  
a client requests a ticket to a server, the lifetime granted to the  
ticket takes into account the \*Lmaxtktlife\*O set for both the server   
and the client.  In other words, the lifetime cannot exceed the  
shorter of the server's or client's \*Lmaxtktlife\*O.  If you do not  
specify a \*Lmaxtktlife\*O for an account, the \*Lmaxtktlife\*O  
defined as registry authorization policy is used.  
.LI "\*Lmaxtktrenew \*Vrelative_time\*O"  
The amount of time before a principal's ticket-granting ticket expires  
and that principal must log in to the system again to reauthenticate  
and obtain another ticket-granting ticket.  Specify the time by using the  
DTS-relative time format   
(\*L[-]\*VDD\*L-\*Vhh\*L:\*Vmm\*L:\*Vss\*O).  The lifetime of the  
principal's service tickets can never exceed the lifetime of the  
principal's ticket-granting ticket.  The shorter you make \*Lmaxtktrenew\*O, the  
greater the security of the system.  However, since principals must log  
in again to renew their ticket-granting ticket, the time needs to balance   
user convenience against level of security required.  
If you do not specify this attribute for an account, the \*Lmaxtktrenew\*O  
lifetime defined as registry authorization policy is used. 
.zA "def,13499,R1.2.2,add not used"
This feature is not currently used by DCE; any use of
this option is unsupported at the present time.
.zZ "def,13499,R1.2.2,add not used"
.LI "\*Lmypwd \*Vpassword\*O"  
Lets you enter your password.   
You must enter your password to create an account.  This check prevents  
a malicious user from using an existing privileged session  
to create unauthorized accounts.  
.LI "\*Lpassword \*Vpassword\*O"  
The password of the account. 
This attribute must be specified 
for the \*Luser create\*O command; there is no default value.  This attribute is not 
returned by a \*Luser show\*O command. 
.LI "\*Lpostdatedtkt \*O{\*Lyes\*O | \*Lno\*O}"  
A flag set to determine whether tickets with a start time some time in the 
future can be issued to the account's principal.  
This attribute must have a value of \*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lno\*O. 
.PP 
.zA "def,13377,R1.2.2,added that attr is advisory" 
In DCE, this attribute is currently only advisory.  However, Kerberos clients and servers  
will use it when they interact with a DCE Security server.  
.zZ "def,13377,R1.2.2,added that attr is advisory" 
.LI "\*Lproxiabletkt \*O{\*Lyes \*O|\*L no\*O}" 
A flag set to determine whether a new ticket with a different 
network address than the present ticket can be issued to the account's 
principal.  The \*Lforwardabletkt\*O attribute performs the same 
function for ticket-granting tickets.  This attribute must have a 
value of \*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lno\*O. 
.PP 
.zA "def,13377,R1.2.2,added that attr is advisory" 
In DCE, this attribute is currently only advisory.  However, Kerberos clients and servers  
will use it when they interact with a DCE Security server. 
.zZ "def,13377,R1.2.2,added that attr is advisory" 
.LI "\*Lpwdvalid \*O{\*Lyes \*O| \*Lno\*O}"   
A flag set to determine whether the current password is valid.  If this  
flag is set to \*Lno\*O, the next time a principal logs in to the  
account, the system prompts the principal to change the password.  (Note  
that this flag is separate from the \*Lpwdexpdate\*O policy, which sets  
time limits on password validity.)  This attribute must have a 
value of
\*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lyes\*O.  
.LI "\*Lrenewabletkt \*O{\*Lyes\*O | \*Lno\*O}"  
A flag set to determine if the ticket-granting ticket issued to the 
account's principal can be renewed.  If this flag is set to \*Lyes\*O, 
the authentication service renews the ticket-granting ticket if its 
lifetime is valid.  This attribute must have a 
value of \*Lyes\*O or 
\*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lyes\*O. 
.PP 
.zA "def,13377,R1.2.2,added that attr is advisory" 
In DCE, this attribute is currently only advisory.  However, Kerberos clients and servers  
will use it when they interact with a DCE Security server. 
.zZ "def,13377,R1.2.2,added that attr is advisory" 
.LI "\*Lserver \*O{\*Lyes\*O | \*Lno\*O}"   
A flag set to indicate whether the account is for a principal that  
can act as a server.  If the account is for a server that engages in  
authenticated communications, set this flag to \*Lyes\*O.  This attribute must have a 
value of \*Lyes\*O or \*Lno\*O.  The default is  
\*Lyes\*O.  
.LI "\*Lshell \*Vpath_to_shell\*O" 
The path of the shell that is executed when a principal logs in.   
The legal value is any shell supported by the home cell.  The default value is  
the empty string (""). 
.LI "\*Lstdtgtauth \*O{\*Lyes \*O| \*Lno\*O}"   
A flag set to determine whether service tickets issued to the  
account's principal use the standard DCE ticket-granting ticket  
authentication mechanism.  This attribute must have a 
value of\*Lyes\*O or  
\*Lno\*O.  The default is \*Lyes\*O.  
.LI "\*Luid \*Vvalue\*O"  
Used with the \*Lcreate\*O operation, this specifies the UNIX ID (uid) for the principal.  
No two principals can have the same  
uid.  However, aliases can share one uid.    
It is often called the Unix ID and is an integer.  If this attribute is not supplied,  
a UID is assigned to principal automatically.

As an alternative to using the \*L-attribute\*O option with an attribute list, you 
can change individual attribute options by prepending a hyphen (\*L-\*O) to any 
attributes listed in \*LATTRIBUTES\*O.  
.LI "\*L-attribute \*Vattribute_list\*O"  
Allows you to specify attributes, including ERAs, by using an attribute list rather than  
using the \*L-\*Vattribute value\*O option. The format of an attribute list is as follows:  
.iS   
{{\*Vattribute \*Vvalue\*O}...{\*Vattribute \*Vvalue\*O}} 
.iE 
.zZ "def,13377,R1.2.2,Clarify -attribute" 
.LI "\*L-force\*O"  
Forces creation of the specified group or organization if they do not exist.  
.LI "\*L-group \*Vgroup_name\*O"  
The name of the group to associate with the account.   
See \*LATTRIBUTES\*O for  
the format of a group name. 
.LI "\*L-mypwd \*Vpassword\*O"  
Your privileged password.  
You must enter your privileged password to create an account.  This check prevents 
a malicious user from using an existing privileged session 
to create unauthorized accounts. 
You must specify this option on the command line; it cannot be  
supplied in a script. 
.LI "\*L-organization \*Vorganization_name\*O"  
The name of the organization to associate with the account.  
See \*LATTRIBUTES\*O for   
the format of an organization name.    
.LI "\*L-password \*Vpassword\*O"  
The account password.  See \*LATTRIBUTES\*O for  
the format of a password.   
.LE  
.PP  
The \*Lcreate\*O operation  
creates a principal name, account, and a directory in CDS for one  
or more DCE users.  The \*Vuser_name_list\*O argument is the name of one  
or more principals to be added to the registry.  This operation  
returns an empty string on success.  If the operation 
encounters an error, it   
attempts to undo any interim operations that have completed.  
.PP  
This command creates one or more principals and accounts for them.  
If a principal or account already exists, an error is generated.  
Each principal is then added to the specified group and  
organization (since the principal has just been created, it cannot   
have been a member of any group or organization).  
If the group or organization does not  
exist, an error is generated unless the \%\*L-force\*O option is used.  
The operation  
creates a CDS directory called \*L/.:/users/\*Vprincipal_name\*O and  
adds an ACL entry to the default ACL so that the user has  
\*Lrwtci\*O permissions on the directory.  These permissions allow all access  
except for deleting the directory and administering replication  
on the directory.  
.PP  
Attributes and policies for the newly created principal and  
account may be specified with the \%\*L-attributes\*O option and  
specifying an attribute list as the value, or with attribute  
options.  This command attempts to add any unknown  
attributes as ERAs on the created principal object.  Policies  
of the organization may not be specified, as they would probably  
affect more than the created user.  The required group and  
organization names may be specified either as attributes in the  
\%\*L-attributes\*O option or via the \*L-group\*O and \*L-organization\*O  
options.  The required \*Lpassword\*O attribute may be provided as in the  
\*Laccount create\*O command, and the \%\*L-mypwd\*O option is also  
required.  
.PP  
\*LPrivileges Required\*O  
.PP  
Because the \*Luser create\*O command performs several operations, you  
need the permissions associated with each operation, as follows:  
.ML  
.LI  
To create the principal name, you must have \*Li\*O (\*Linsert\*O)   
permission to the directory in which the principal is to be created.  
.LI  
If the specified groups or organizations do not already exist and you  
use the \%\*L-force\*O option, you must have \*Li\*O (\*Linsert\*O)  
permission to the directories in which the groups and organizations   
are to be created.

.SS "user delete"  
.PP  
Deletes DCE users.  The syntax is as follows:  
.sS  
\*Luser delete \*Vuser_name_list\*O  
.sE 
.PP  
The \*Ldelete\*O operation  
deletes the DCE users named in \*Vuser_name_list\*O.  To delete   
a user, the operation procedes as follows:  
.ML  
.LI  
Deletes the principal from the  
registry, which also deletes the account and removes the  
principal from any groups and organizations.    
.LI  
Deletes the  
\*L/.:/users/\*Vprincipal_name\*O directory and any contents.    
.LE  
This operation returns  
an empty string on success.  
.PP  
\*LPrivileges Required\*O  
.PP  
Because the \*Luser delete\*O command performs several operations, you  
need the permissions associated with each operation:  
.ML  
.LI  
You must have \*Ld\*O (\*Ldelete\*O) permission to the directory   
in which the target principal exists.  
You must have \*Lr\*O (\*Lread\*O) and \*LD\*O (\*LDelete_object\*O)  
permission on the principal to be deleted.  
.LI  
You must have \*Lr\*O (\*Lread\*O) and \*LM\*O  
(\*LMember_list\*O) permission on the target groups and organizations  
and \*Lr\*O (\*Lread\*O) permission on the member to be removed.  
.LI  
To delete the account, you must have \*Lr\*O (\*Lread\*O),  
\*Lm\*O (\*Lmgmt_info\*O), \*La\*O (\*Lauth_info\*O), and  
\*Lu\*O (\*Luser_info\*O) permissions for the principal named in the account.  
.LI  
To delete the directory in CDS, you must have   
\*Ld\*O (\*Ldelete\*O) permission to the directory and   
\*Lw\*O (\*Lwrite\*O) permission to the   
clearinghouse that stores the master replica of the directory.  The server   
principal needs \*La\*O (\*Lauth_info\*O) permission   
to the parent directory or \*Ld\*O (\*Ldelete\*O) permission to the   
child pointer that points to the directory you intend to delete.  
.LE  
.PP  
\*LExamples\*O  
.PP  
The following example deletes user \*LK_Parsons\*O from the cell:  
.oS  
dcecp> \*Luser delete K_Parsons\*C 
dcecp>  
.oE  
.SS "user help"  
.PP  
Returns help information about the \*Luser\*O task object and its  
operations.  The syntax is as follows:  
.sS  
\*Luser help \*O[\*Voperation\*O | \*L-verbose\*O]  
.sE  
.PP  
\*LOptions\*O  
.VL  
.LI "\*L-verbose\*O"   
Displays information about the \*Luser\*O task object.  
.LE  
.PP  
Used without an argument or option, the  
\*Luser help\*O command returns brief information about each  
\*Luser\*O operation.   
The optional \*Voperation\*O argument is the name of an operation  
about which you want detailed information.    
Alternatively, you can use the \%\*L-verbose\*O option for more detailed  
information about the \*Luser\*O task object itself.  
.PP  
\*LPrivileges Required\*O  
.PP  
No special privileges are needed to use the \*Luser help\*O  
command.

.oS  
dcecp> \*Luser help\*C              
create              Creates a DCE user.  
delete              Deletes a DCE user.  
show                Shows the attributes of a DCE user.  
help                Prints a summary of command-line options.  
operations          Returns a list of the valid operations for this command. 
dcecp>  
.oE  
.SS "user operations" 
.PP 
Returns a list of the operations supported by the  
\*Luser\*O  
task object. 
The syntax is as follows: 
.sS 
\*Luser operations\*O 
.sE 
.PP 
The list of available operations is in alphabetical order   
except for \*Lhelp\*O and \*Loperations\*O, which are listed last. 
.PP  
\*LPrivileges Required\*O

.SS "user show"  
Returns the attributes of a single DCE user.  The syntax is as follows:  
.sS  
\*Luser show \*Vuser_name_list\*O  
.sE  
.PP  
The \*Lshow\*O operation  
returns the attributes of the users named in \*Vuser_name_list\*O.  
The information returned includes  
principal attributes, account attributes, and  
policies.  The information is returned as if the following  
commands were run in the following order:  
.oS  
principal show  
account show -all  
.oE
