.SH "NAME" 
\*Lsynchronize\*O - Causes the DTS entity to synchronize the clock 
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
.sS
\*Ldtscp synchronize\*O [\*Lset clock\*O {\*Ltrue\*O | \*Lfalse\*O}]
.sE
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.VL
.LI "\*Lset clock\*O {\*Ltrue\*O | \*Lfalse\*O}"
Specifies whether the clock is abruptly set (\*Ltrue\*O)
or gradually adjusted to the computed time (\*Lfalse\*O, the default).
This argument is optional.
.LE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \*Lsynchronize\*O command causes the Distributed Time Service
(DTS) clerk or server to solicit time intervals
from servers, compute the intersection of the time intervals, and adjust the
system clock to the midpoint of the computed time interval. 
This command overrides the
functions of the \*Lsynchronization hold down\*O characteristic.
.SS "Privileges Required"
.PP
You must have \*Lw\*O (\*Lwrite\*O) permission 
on the access control list (ACL) associated with the DTS entity in order
to execute the command.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
The \*Lsynchronize\*O command does not execute if the entity is already
synchronizing or is disabled; the entity must be in the \*Lon\*O state. 
.PP
This command is replaced at DCE Version 1.1 by the \*Ldcecp\*O 
command and may not be provided in future releases of DCE.
...\".SH "EXIT VALUES"
...\".PP
...\".VL 8m
...\".LI "Wrong State"
...\"The command failed because the DTS
...\"entity is in the \*Loff\*O, \*Lsynchronizing\*O, or 
...\"\*Lupdating\*O state (not in the \*Lon\*O state).
...\".LE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.AL
.LI
The following command initiates a synchronization for the entity,
followed by a gradual clock adjustment:
.oS
dtscp> \*Lsynchronize
.oE
.LI
The following command initiates a synchronization for the entity,
followed by an abrupt reset of the clock:
.oS
dtscp> \*Lsynchronize set clock true
