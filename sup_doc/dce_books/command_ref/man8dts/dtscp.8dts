.nS note
With the exception of the following subcommands, this command is
replaced at DCE Version 1.1 by the \*Ldcecp\*O command.  This command may
be fully replaced by the \*Ldcecp\*O command in a future release of
DCE, and may no longer be supported at that time.

The \*L*(8dts)\*O reference pages describe 
the commands for the Distributed Time Service (DTS)
control program, \*Ldtscp\*O.  The DTS control program
is a command-line interface that enables you to synchronize, adjust, and
maintain the system clocks in a distributed network.  
For a detailed explanation
of system clock synchronization and management, see the \*(Ag.
.PP
The DTS control program commands are as follows:
.VL 1i
.LI "\*Ladvertise\*O"
Configures the DTS server as a global server.
.LI "\*Lchange\*O"
Modifies the epoch and sets the local time to a new time.
.LI "\*Lcreate\*O"
Establishes a DTS entity (a clerk or server).
.LI "\*Ldelete\*O"
Causes DTS to exit on the local node.
.LI "\*Ldisable\*O"
Suspends a DTS entity. 
.LI "\*Lenable\*O"
Starts a DTS entity. 
.LI "\*Lexit\*O"
Ends the \*Ldtscp\*O management session and returns you to the system prompt.
.LI "\*Lhelp\*O"
Invokes the \*Ldtscp\*O help service.
.LI "\*Lquit\*O"
Ends the \*Ldtscp\*O management session and returns you to the system prompt.
.LI "\*Lset\*O"
Modifies characteristics of a DTS entity.
.LI "\*Lshow\*O"
Displays characteristics of a DTS entity.
.LI "\*Lsynchronize\*O"
Synchronizes the system clock with the time obtained from DTS 
servers in the network.
.LI "\*Lunadvertise\*O"
Removes the global server entry.
.LI "\*Lupdate\*O"
Gradually adjusts the system clock to a new time.
.LE
.PP
For more information on any of the above \*Ldtscp\*O commands, see the
appropriate reference page.
.PP
You can use control program commands from within the control program or from
the system prompt.  To enter DTS commands from within the control program, first
start the control program by entering the \*Ldtscp\*O command. 
For example:
.iS
dtscp\*C 
dtscp>
.iE
At this prompt you can enter any control program command.  For example:
.oS
dtscp> \*Lshow current time
.oE
.P
To leave the control program and return to the system prompt, enter the
\*Lexit\*O command.
.PP
To enter DTS commands from the system prompt, interactively or in a command
procedure, enter the \*Ldtscp\*O command with an internal command of the
control program as the first argument.  The control program executes the command
without displaying the control program prompt.  For example, you can enter the
\*Lsynchronize\*O command as follows:
.iS
dtscp synchronize
.iE
.PP
Some \*Ldtscp\*O commands have optional arguments or attributes, and
there may also be optional variables for the arguments and attributes.  
This is shown in the following diagram:
.oS
dtscp> \*Lupdate time 1990-08-03-05:45:28.000+01:00I00.500\*C
       /     /           /
 Command  [Argument]  Variable
           --------
          [Attribute]
.oE
.nL
.ne 8
.SS "Abbreviations"
.PP
You can enter as few as three characters for each DTS command or argument; DTS
commands and arguments are unique for three characters or more.  For example,
rather than entering the command \*Lenable set clock true\*O, you can enter
the following abbreviated command:
.oS
dtscp> \*Lena set clo tru
.oE
.SS "Attributes"
.PP
The \*Ldtscp\*O \*Lset\*O and \*Lshow\*O commands have several
attributes\(empieces or sets of data\(emassociated with them.  The attribute
groups are categorized as follows:
.PP
.VL 1.25i
.LI "\*LCharacteristics\*O"
Set or show the entity's operation.
.LI "\*LCounters\*O"
Show the number of occurrences of an event since the entity was enabled.
.LI "\*LStatus\*O"
Show the current state of the entity. (The
DTS entity has four status attributes.)
.LI "\*LGlobal Servers\*O"
Show the global servers known by this DTS entity.
.LI "\*LLocal Servers\*O"
Show the local servers known by this DTS entity.
.LE
.PP
Individual attributes within each of the previously listed groups are described
in the \*Lset(8dts)\*O and \*Lshow(8dts)\*O reference pages.  The
\*Lshow\*O command also allows you to specify attribute groups.
.SS Time Stamps
.iX "-[" "timestamps" "format"
.PP
All responses to commands contain a timestamp.
The following is a typical DTS time display:
.oS
1993-03-16-14:29:47.52000-05:00I000.003
.oE
.PP
The timestamp uses the DTS format as explained in the \*(Ac.
In this example, the year is 1993,
the day is March 16, and the time is 14 hours,
29 minutes, and 47.52 seconds.  A negative Time Differential Factor (TDF) of 5
hours and an inaccuracy of 3 milliseconds is included in the timestamp.
.nS note
An inaccuracy value of \*LI-----\*O indicates an infinite inaccuracy.
This value appears in time displays before a node's initial synchronization,
or after you enter the \*Lchange\*O command without specifying an inaccuracy 
value.
