.SH "NAME"
\*Ldts_intro\*O - Introduction to the DCE DTS commands
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The DCE Distributed Time Service (DTS) provides the following facilities:
.VL
.LI "\*Ldtsd\*O"
The DTS daemon 
.LI "\*Ldtscp\*O"
The DTS control program
.LI "\*Ldtsdate\*O"
The DTS local clock setting program 
.LE
.PP
DTS is implemented in the \*Ldtsd\*O process.  Both clerks and
servers use the same daemon.  The behavior of \*Ldtsd\*O is
determined by \*Ldtscp\*O.
.PP
The DTS control program allows
you to synchronize, adjust, and maintain the system clocks in a 
distributed network.  The \*Ldtscp\*O commands are as follows:
.VL 1i
.LI "\*Ladvertise\*O"
Configures the DTS server as a global server.
.LI "\*Lchange\*O"
Modifies the epoch and sets the local time to a new time.
.LI "\*Lcreate\*O"
Establishes a DTS entity (a clerk or server).
.LI "\*Ldelete\*O"
Causes DTS to exit on the local node.
.LI "\*Ldisable\*O"
Suspends a DTS entity. 
.LI "\*Lenable\*O"
Starts a DTS entity. 
.LI "\*Lexit\*O"
Ends the \*Ldtscp\*O management session and returns you to the system prompt.
.LI "\*Lhelp\*O"
Invokes the \*Ldtscp\*O help service.
.LI "\*Lquit\*O"
Ends the \*Ldtscp\*O management session and returns you to the system prompt.
.LI "\*Lset\*O"
Modifies characteristics of a DTS entity.
.LI "\*Lshow\*O"
Displays characteristics of a DTS entity.
.LI "\*Lsynchronize\*O"
Synchronizes the system clock with the time obtained from DTS 
servers in the network.
.LI "\*Lunadvertise\*O"
Removes the global server entry.
.LI "\*Lupdate\*O"
Gradually adjusts the system clock to a new time.
.LE
.PP
For more information on any of the \*Ldtscp\*O commands, see the
appropriate reference page.
.PP
The \*Ldtsd\*O command restarts the DTS daemon (clerk or server process).  When
the host system is rebooted, this command is automatically executed as part of
the overall DCE configuration procedure.
.PP
Invocation of \*Ldtsd\*O leaves it in an idle state.  In order for it
to assume an identity, it must be \*Ecreated\*O with the \*Ldtscp
create\*O command.
.PP
After the DTS entity is created, it is still in a nonfunctioning
state.  To put it into operation, you must invoke \*Ldtscp enable\*O,
which causes an immediate synchronization to take place. 
.PP
To bring down a DTS entity, you must first stop it with \*Ldtscp
disable\*O and then delete it with \*Ldtscp delete\*O.  
.PP
The \*Ldtsdate\*O command sets the local clock of a system to be the
same as the host \*Vremote_host\*O, running a \*Ldtsd\*O server.
