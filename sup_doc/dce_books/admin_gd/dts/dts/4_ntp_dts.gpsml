.H 1 "Interoperation with Network Time Protocol"
.P
.iX "-: NTP" "Network Time Protocol"
.iX "-[" "NTP" "interoperation with DTS"
.iX "-[" "DTS" "interoperation with NTP"
Network Time Protocol (NTP) is an Internet-recommended standard.  The NTP
synchronization subnetwork is represented by a tree-structured graph with
nodes representing time servers and edges representing the transmission paths
between them.  The root nodes of the tree are designated primary servers that
synchronize to a radio broadcast or calibrated atomic clock.  Remaining nodes
are designated secondary servers that synchronize to other servers (primary
and secondary).
.P
The number of subnetwork hops between a particular server and a primary server
determines the stratum of that server; that is,
the smaller the number of hops, the lower the stratum.  A lower-stratum server
always has a higher accuracy than a higher-stratum server.  All servers have
identical functionality and can operate simultaneously as clients of the next
lower stratum and servers for the next higher stratum.
.P 
Servers, both primary and secondary, typically run NTP with several other
servers at the same or lower stratum.  A selection algorithm attempts to select
the most accurate and reliable server or set of servers from which to actually
synchronize the local clock.
.P
NTP and DTS both can be used in large computer networks that have embedded
local nets (that is, those connected by routers, gateways, and bridges) and
use both broadcast and point-to-point transmission media.  DTS and NTP can run 
simultaneously on the same LAN.
.P
.ne 2
The following sections describe 
how to give time to and get time from local and remote NTP time sources,
and how to prevent loops.
.H 2 "Getting the Time from NTP Time Sources"
.P
.iX "-[" "NTP" "getting time from"
DTS provides two sample time-provider programs:
.ML
.LI
.iX "\*Ldts_ntp_provider.c\*O"
\*Ldts_ntp_provider.c\*O\(emTakes the time from an NTP server as it would 
from a radio receiver.  The user specifies the name of the NTP server and the 
inaccuracy.
.LI
.iX "\*Ldts_null_provider.c\*O"
\*Ldts_null_provider.c\*O\(emUsed on a DTS server whose clock is already 
synchronized by an external agent, such as NTP.  It sets the inaccuracy, but 
it prevents DTS from setting the time.  The user sets the inaccuracy based
on local experience with NTP.  The null provider may be useful for sites that
already have a radio clock that is managed by NTP.  Make the node with the
radio clock a DTS server and use the null time-provider.
.LE
.H 3 "Getting the Time from Local NTP Time Sources"
.P
Run the DTS server on a node that is running an NTP clock driver with a clock
and the null time-provider.  Specify the inaccuracy in a manner that is
consistent with the time source; for instance, a radio clock.  Other DTS
servers will take the time from this source.  In this case, since the system
is connected to a time source, it is an NTP Stratum 1 server.
.P
Observe the rules and advisories that follow:
.ML
.LI
Rule\(emIf this is the only local time source 
.gL "local time source"
(radio clock) in the subnetwork, ensure that no other DTS node gives the 
time to NTP.  If, however, there are other local time sources, this 
restriction does not apply.
.LI 
Rule\(emDo not run the null time-provider 
if there is no local time source.
.LI
Advisory\(emUse a very small poll rate, about 1 second.
.LI
Advisory\(emSince NTP makes the \*Ladjtime(\|)\*O system call, be
aware that the local node will occasionally have an unspecified inaccuracy.
.LE
.P
Figure 26-1 shows how a DTS server/client with a local time 
source takes time from an NTP Stratum 1 server.
.P
.FG "Local Time Source"
.pI ../dts/dts/figures/4_ntp_dts_10.ps 0 0 1
.H 3 "Getting the Time from Remote NTP Time Sources"
.P
Run the DTS server with the NTP time-provider (\*Ldts_ntp_provider.c\*O) on a 
node with access to an NTP server.  Specify the inaccuracy in a manner that is 
consistent with local NTP experience.
.P
Observe the following advisories:
.ML
.LI
Advisory\(emIf links to remote sources are distant, 
consider having one of the subnetwork nodes run the NTP locally.
.LI 
Advisory\(emNote that the NTP time-provider does not accept time from an 
NTP node at Stratum 8 or higher.
.LI
Advisory\(emThe NTP node needs to be as close to Stratum 1 as possible.
.LE
.P
Figures 26-2 and 26-3 both show a DTS server getting the time from a remote 
NTP time source, which is a Stratum 3 server.  However, in Figure 26-2
(Scenario 1), all of the advisories in this section
...\" about how to get the time from ...\" remote NTP time sources 
are followed; in Figure 26-3 (Scenario 2), the first
advisory, running NTP locally on one of the subnetwork nodes if the 
link to a remote source is distant, is ignored.

Any DTS server or clerk that runs the \*Lntpd\*O daemon or the \*Lxntpd\*O
daemon with the \%\*L-s\*O option and a special configuration file
(\*Lntp.conf\*O) can be configured as an NTP server.
.P
For systems running the \*Lntpd\*O daemon, the \*Lntp.conf\*O configuration 
file must contain the following line:
.oS
peer /dev/null DTSS 8 -5 local
.oE
.P
In addition, add \*L-s\*O to the \*Lntpd\*O entry in the file 
\*L/sbin/init.d/ntpd\*O or, for systems with \*Lrc.local\*O,
modify the line that starts \*Lntpd\*O accordingly.
.P
For systems running the \*Lxntpd\*O daemon, the \*Lntp.conf\*O configuration 
file must contain the following line:
.oS
peer 127.127.1.8
.oE
.P
In addition, add \*L-s\*O to the \*Lxntpd\*O entry in the file 
\*L/sbin/init.d/xntpd\*O or, for systems with \*Lrc.local\*O, modify the line 
that starts \*Lxntpd\*O accordingly.
.P
In this configuration, NTP \*Vnever\*O sets the clock.  NTP can, however, give 
the time to other NTP clients.  Do \*Enot\*O 
allow loops between DTS and NTP to form.
If NTP gives the time to DTS, then DTS gives the time back to the \*Vsame\*O
set of NTP servers, unexpected results can occur.
.P
The NTP configuration file is set up to ensure that an NTP server that
obtains the time from DTS is a Stratum 8 node.  In addition, 
\*Ldts_ntp_provider\*O is prohibited from accepting time from a node at
Stratum 8 or higher.
.P
A DTS (server) node can give time to an NTP node if the following rules and
advisories are observed:
.ML
.LI
Rule\(emThe \*Lntp.conf\*O file must declare this node at Stratum 8.
.LI
Advisory\(emMultiple nodes in the set can be running 
\*Lntpd\*O \*L-s\*O or \*Lxntpd\*O \*L-s\*O.
.LI
Advisory\(emIf any DTS-managed system has a local time source, 
that system should be used as an NTP \*L-s\*O server.
.LI
Advisory\(emAlthough this operation can occur on either a 
DTS server or a DTS client node, a DTS server is preferred.
.LE
.nS note
If null providers are used, the rules in Section 26.1.1
...\" that describes how to get
...\" the time from local NTP sources 
must also be followed, since null providers 
running on NTP nodes can bypass the stratum check.
.nE
.P
Figure 26-4 shows two DTS server nodes running \*Lntpd\*O \*L-s\*O and 
providing time to an NTP subnetwork.  The \*Lntp.conf\*O file defines these 
servers at Stratum 8.

Run the null time-provider (\*Ldts_null_provider.c\*O) only if you have a

If the remote NTP Stratum 2 node fails, the Stratum 3 node starts 
accepting time from the Stratum 8 node.  Once this occurs, the Stratum 3 node
