.H 1 "Viewing the Structure and Contents of a Namespace"
.P
.iX "-[" "CDS" "viewing the namespace"
.zA "def,13578,R1.2.2,Removed cdscp, which is replaced by dcecp"
When you need to view the structure and contents of the cell namespace, you
can use one or more programs provided by CDS.  The CDS browser
(\*Lcdsbrowser\*O) allows you to display namespace information in a windowing
environment, while the DCE control program (\*Ldcecp\*O)
displays information through its command 
line interface.  This chapter explains how to use
the CDS browser and \*Ldcecp\*O to display namespace information.
.zZ "def,13578,R1.2.2,Removed cdscp, which is replaced by dcecp"
.H 2 "Viewing the Namespace with the CDS Browser"
.iX "-[" "CDS" "browser" "how to use"
.P
The CDS browser is a tool for viewing the content and structure of a namespace,
which runs on workstations with the OSF/Motif graphical user interface or
compatible software.  The program can display an overall directory structure
as well as show the contents of directories, enabling you to monitor growth
in the size and number of directories in a namespace.  You also can customize
the CDS browser so that it displays only a specific class of object names.
.P
.ne  3
To start the CDS browser, enter the following command at your system prompt:
.iS
\*C$ \*Lcdsbrowser
.iE
.P
To end a CDS browser session and return to your system prompt, choose Quit from
the File pull-down menu.  
(See the \*Lcdsbrowser(8cds)\*O reference page
for a complete description of the \*Lcdsbrowser\*O command.)
.H 3 "Displaying the Default Namespace"
.P
The CDS browser lets you view the default namespace for your system.  You can
see only the entries in the namespace to which you have read permission.
Directories to which you do not have read permission do not appear.  
When you use the CDS browser, it sets the confidence level of clerk calls
to low.
.P
When you start the CDS browser, an icon representing the root directory is the
first item to be displayed in the window.  Directories, soft links, and object
entries all have distinct icons associated with them.
Table 19-1 shows the CDS browser icons and what they represent.
.P
.TB "CDS Browser Icons and Their Meaning"
.pI ../directory/cds/figures/9_cds_view_10.ps 0 0 1
.P
To expand  
.gL "expand"
(open) the root directory, double-click on it.  Double-click 
on the expanded directory to collapse  
.gL "collapse"
(close) it.  When you expand a directory, you see all of the soft links
and object entries that it contains.  Object entries can 
represent clearinghouses or any resource for which a client application
creates entries in the namespace.  Note that
object entries representing clearinghouses are shown with a different
icon than are ordinary object entries.  All entries, such as
object entries, soft links, and directories, are shown indented from their
parent directories.
.H 3 "Expanding and Collapsing Selected Directories"
.P
By double-clicking on single directories, you can continue expanding a
particular directory pathname one level at a time.  Other methods are available
to expand all directories at once or to expand selected groups of
directories.
.P
To expand or collapse a group of directories, select them and
double-click on them.  Note that, because double-clicking has a toggle
effect, you can expand or collapse groups of directories only one level at
a time.  If you double-click multiple directory levels at one time, the
result may be the opposite of what you expect.
.P
To expand or collapse selected directories level by level, click on the
first directory that you want to select, then continue selecting directories by
shift-clicking (pressing 
.kY Shift 
and clicking) on them.
When you select the last directory, press 
.kY Shift 
and double-click,
instead of single-clicking, on it.  This selects the last directory and
expands or collapses all of the directories that you selected.
.H 3 "Expanding and Collapsing the Entire Cell Namespace"
.P
To expand all directories on all levels at once, choose the Expand All
option from the File menu.  Likewise, choose Collapse All from the File menu
to close an expanded namespace.
.nS "note"
Use Expand All with care if you have a large namespace.  The larger a
namespace, the longer it takes to display its entire contents.
.nE
.H 3 "Filtering the Namespace Display"
.P
Using the Filters menu, you can selectively display object entries of a
particular class.  For example, if you are interested in seeing the entries
for clearinghouse objects only, choose the class \*LCDS_Clearinghouse\*O
from the Filters menu.  For any directory that you expand after choosing a
filter, you see only names of objects whose class matches the filter.
.P
.ne 4
Note that soft links are still displayed because they are not object entries and
only object entries can be filtered out.  To reset the filter so that you
can again view all object entries, choose the \*L*\*O (asterisk) from the
Filters menu.
.H 3 "Navigating the Namespace"
.P
Once you begin expanding the namespace, it can exceed the boundaries of your
CDS browser window, even if you enlarge the window.  You can use the horizontal
and vertical scroll bars and stepping arrows to scroll through the
namespace.
.P
Dragging the slider up and down the vertical scroll bar on the right side of
the display window produces an index window.  The index window shows the name
where the slider is currently positioned in the namespace.  When the index
window contains the name that you want to view,
release the mouse button to position that name at the top of the CDS browser
window.
.P
In displays that are larger than the length of the window, scrolling through
directory levels can produce a reference line toward the top of the
window.  The line orients you by showing the full directory pathname from
the current name to the root.  It also indicates that you have scrolled past
other parts of the namespace that are no longer displayed.
.iX "-]" "CDS" "browser" "how to use"
.H 2 "Listing the Contents of Directories"
.P
.iX "-[" "CDS" "listing contents of directories" 
.iX "-[" "\*Ldcecp\*O commands" "\*Llist\*O"
The DCE control program (\*Ldcecp\*O) provides a \*Ldirectory list\*O command 
that allows you
to display a list of the descendants of a directory within the cell namespace.
A directory's descendants are all the child pointers, clearinghouses,
object entries, and soft links existing in it.
.P
To use the \*Ldirectory list\*O command, you must have read permission to
the CDS names that you want to display.
.P
For a complete listing of a directory's contents, you enter the
\*Ldirectory list\*O command with the name of the directory or directories
whose contents you wish to view.  For example:
.iS
.ne 1
\*Cdcecp> \*Ldirectory list /.:/eng\*C
/.../eng_cell.osf.org/hosts/eng/aud-acl \\ 
/.../eng_cell.osf.org/hosts/eng/aud-svc \\

/.../eng_cell\.osf.org/hosts/eng/CDS_CTS \\
/.../eng_cell.osf.org/hosts/eng/CDS_UTS \\
\*Cdcecp>
.iE
.P
.ns "note"
By default, the \*Ldirectory list\*O command displays the full names of the
objects (the object names preceeded by \*L/.../\*Vpathname\*O ) contained
in the directory.  To list only the RDNs of the objects, enter
the \*Ldirectory list\*O command with the \%\*L-simplename\*O option.
.P
To display the names of a particular kind of directory descendant only,
you include the appropriate option of the \*Ldirectory list\*O command.  For
example, you enter the following command to display the names of all
the soft links that are stored in the \*L/.:/eng\*O directory:
.iS
\*Cdcecp> \*Ldirectory list  /.:/eng/ -links\*C
/.../eng_cell.osf.org/hosts/eng/CDS_CTS \\
/.../eng_cell.osf.org/hosts/eng/CDS_UTS

.iX "-[" "CDS" "displaying attribute values"
.iX "-[" "\*Ldcecp\*O commands" "\*Lshow\*O"
.zA "def,13575,R1.2.2,Replaced command with operation"
To display any or all of the current values of the attributes associated
with the names in a namespace (except for clerks or servers), use the
\*Ldcecp\*O \*Lshow\*O operation.
.P
The basic syntax of the \*Lshow\*O operation is as follows:
.iS
\*Vobject-type\*O \*Lshow\*O \*Vobject-name\*O
.iE
.P
.ne 4
where
\*Vobject-type\*O
is the type of CDS object about which you want to display information,
and \*Vobject-name\*O
is a complete directory specification terminating with a simple name
(that is, the full CDS name) of the object you are inquiring about.
.P
To use the \*Lshow\*O operation, you must have read permission to the name
that you want to display.
.P
In the following example, the \*Lshow\*O operation displays the
current values of the \*LCDS_CHDirectories\*O
attribute associated with the \*L/.:/Chicago2_CH\*O clearinghouse.  The
display returned by the operation shows two values for the attribute,
each value having two parts.  The parts of the attribute value
are UUID of Directory and Name of Directory.  The \*Lshow\*O operation
displays the values separately.  For each value, it first lists the
attribute name on a line ending with a colon, then the parts of the
value.
