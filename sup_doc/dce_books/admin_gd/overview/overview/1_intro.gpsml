.iX "-; machines" "hosts"
.H 1 "Introduction to DCE for Administrators"
.P
.iX "-[" "administering DCE" "about"
The \*(In introduced you to the OSF Distributed Computing Environment (DCE),
describing the major components of its services.  This chapter provides
an overview of DCE from the perspective of the system or network
administrator.
.P
As the \*(In explains, DCE is a set of services that together make up a
high-level coherent environment for developing and running distributed
applications.  These services include a set of tools that support
DCE management tasks.  DCE applies techniques that you may have learned
from working with applications for single machines or other distributed
systems.  These techniques enable system administrators to manage DCE without
having to know about system internals. 
You can start with a configuration that is appropriate for your initial needs
and grow to larger configurations without sacrificing reliability or
flexibility. 
DCE supports large networks with many users, as well as smaller
networks.
.P
The following concepts, which are described in the
remaining sections of this chapter, are
central to DCE system administration:
.ML
.LI 
Clients and servers to make and respond to requests
for a service
.LI
Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) for client-to-server communications
.LI 
Cells, which are groups of users, servers, and machines that
share security, administrative, and naming boundaries
.LI
A single namespace that lets client applications identify,
locate, and manage objects, including users, machines, servers,
groups of servers, and directories
.LI
A single filespace that allows data sharing among users and
machines with proper authorization
.LI
Principals, which are entities\(emincluding users, servers,
and computers\(emthat are capable of communicating
securely with other entities
.LI
Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control access to objects 
.LI
Caching, which is the technique of using 
a local copy of information to avoid looking
up the centrally stored information each time it is needed
.LI
Replication, which is the process by which copies of information are 
created and kept consistent
.LE
.H 2 "Clients and Servers"
.iX "client/server model"
.P
DCE is based on the client/server model.
A server is a machine or process that provides a specialized service
to other machines or processes.
A client is a machine or process that uses a server's specialized
service during the course of its own work.
Distributed applications consist of a client side that initiates a
request for service, and a server side that receives and executes that
request, and returns any results to the client.
For example, a client can request that a file be printed, and the
server where the printer resides carries out that request.
.P
More than one server process can reside on a single machine.  
Also, one machine can be both a client and a server.  
For example, a machine can be a client for one DCE component and a
server for another.
.P
Figure 1-1 shows a machine that is a name server for a
client that issues a name request.
The same machine is a client for a file server.

.PE
.H 2 "Remote Procedure Call"
.iX "Remote Procedure Call (RPC)" "about"
.P
A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a synchronous request and response
between a local calling program and a remote procedure.
An RPC begins with a request from a local calling program to use a
remote procedure.
It completes when the calling program receives all the results (or
an error status or exception) from the procedure.
.H 2 "The Cell"
.iX "-[" "cells" "about"
.P
The cell is the basic unit of administration in DCE.
A cell usually consists of users, machines, and resources that share a 
common purpose and a greater level of trust with each other than with
users, machines, and resources outside of the cell.
Members of a cell are usually located in a common geographic area, but
they can also be located in different buildings, different cities, or even
different countries, provided they are adequately connected.
A cell's size can range from only one machine to several thousand,
depending on the size of the organization.
All machines in an organization can be included in one cell, or you
can choose to have numerous cells within one organization.
.P
Cells designate security, administrative, and naming boundaries for
users and resources.
Each cell has a name.
Cell names are established during the installation and configuration
of DCE components.
.P
Members of an organization who are working on the same project are
likely to belong to the same cell.
For example, in a large organization with several cells, the sales
team could belong to one cell, the engineers working on Project X
could belong to a second cell, and the engineers working on Project
Y could belong to a third cell.
On the other hand, a small organization may have only one cell for
both the sales force and the engineers because they share the same
level of security and the organization's small size does not warrant
the additional administrative overhead that maintaining additional
cells requires.
.P
DCE services are managed within the context of a cell,
as described by the following examples:
.ML
.LI
Each DCE cell typically consists of at least one Cell Directory Service (CDS)
server, three Distributed Time Service (DTS) servers, and one Security Service
server, as well as the databases that the CDS and Security servers use.
.LI
Pathnames of DCE objects managed by DCE services can be
expressed relative to the cell where the objects reside.
.LI
DTS has both local and global servers.  Local servers operate within a
Local Area Network (LAN).  Global servers provide time services anywhere
within the cell.
.LE
.iX "-]" "cells" "about"
.H 2 "The Namespace"
.iX "namespace" "about"
.P
The namespace is the hierarchical set of names of DCE objects.
The top levels of the hierarchy are managed by the Directory
Service. Some DCE services (currently the Security Service and Distributed
File Service (DFS)) manage their own portions of the namespace.
Each DCE object in the namespace consists of a name with
associated \*Eattributes\*O (pieces of information) that describe its
characteristics.  These objects include resources such as machines or
applications.
.P
The namespace contains global namespaces and cell namespaces.  A
\*Ecell namespace\*O includes objects that are registered within a
cell.  A logical picture of a cell namespace is a hierarchical tree with the
cell root directory at the top and one or more levels of directories
containing names beneath the cell root.  The cell namespace is managed by
the Cell Directory Service (CDS) component of the Directory Service. 
Conversely, the \*Eglobal namespace\*O, as seen from a local DCE cell,
contains objects that are registered outside the local cell,
such as the names of other cells. 
The Global Directory Service (GDS) component of the Directory Service
manages one part of the global namespace;
a non-DCE service called the Domain Name System (DNS) manages
another part of the global namespace.
.P
Administrative tools use the namespace to store information and to
locate DCE services. DCE services advertise their locations to the
namespace.  The namespace provides a means of organizing DCE services into
manageable groups.
.H 2 "The Filespace"
.iX "filespace" "about"
.P
Part of the cell namespace is the filespace, which 
consists of files and directories. 
These can be physically stored on many different machines, but are
available to users on every machine, as long as those users have the
proper authorization.  
You manage the filespace in units called \*Efilesets\*O, which are
hierarchical groupings of related files. 
Although files are distributed throughout the network, located on and
managed by different servers, users see a single filespace.   
DCE provides administrative tools to assist you in backing up, moving,
and replicating filesets.
.H 2 "Principals"
.iX "principals" "about"
.P
A DCE principal is an identity that is authenticated by the Security
Service. 
When you log into your system, you use your principal name. 
Principals can be organized into groups and into organizations that
contain groups of principals. 
Information associated with a principal includes information
that is traditionally kept in UNIX
group and password files, such as the username, group 
ID, members of a group, and a user's home directory. 
By default, a principal is known within the bounds of a cell. 
By creating a special account that indicates you trust another cell's
authentication service, you can enable principals from other cells to
participate securely within your cell.
.nL
.ne 10
.H 2 "Access Control Lists"
.iX "-[" "access control lists (ACLs)" "about"
.P
An Access Control List (ACL) is an authorization mechanism that allows
you to assign permissions that control access to DCE objects.
The following DCE objects are protected by ACLs:
.ML
.LI
Principals and groups of principals managed by the Security Service
.LI
Files and file system directories managed by the DFS
.LI
DTS servers
.LI
CDS directories and entries
.LI
CDS clients and servers, which have ACLs restricting the use of their
management operations (for example, creating a clearinghouse)
.LI
GDS entries managed by GDS's own ACL mechanism, as described in 
...\" Part 4 of this guide
the \*(Ax
.LE
.SP 1 
An ACL consists of multiple \*EACL entries\*O that define the
following:
.ML
.LI
Who can use an object
.LI
What operations can be performed on the object
.LE
.P
.SP 1
In the filespace, ACLs are an extension of the UNIX system's
file protection model. 
Whereas UNIX file system permissions are limited to the protection of
files and directories, DCE ACLs can also control access to other
objects, such as individual database entries, objects
registered in the cell namespace, and objects managed by applications.
.iX "-]" "access control lists (ACLs)" "about"
.H 2 "Caching"
.iX "caching" "about"
.P
Information acquired over the network (for example, through the use of DCE
RPC) can be stored in a memory or disk cache on the local machine. 
This technique reduces network load and speeds up lookups of
frequently needed data. 
For example, information about the namespace and the filespace is
cached by DCE client machines.
.P
Caching can be configured on a service-by-service basis. 
Different caching mechanisms are used for different components of DCE. 
Each component has configurable options to improve the performance of
your installation.
.H 2 "Replication"
.iX "replication" "about"
.P
Replication increases the availability of
resources by having copies of the resource on several machines. 
For example, with replication you can make database updates on one machine
and have them automatically made on other machines in the network.  
You can replicate data, move replicas, and control the frequency of
updates.  
The Security Service, CDS, GDS, and DFS all provide replication
facilities that are customized for their particular applications.
