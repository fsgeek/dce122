\*Lgdssetup\*O - Simplifies the process of configuring and initializing GDS
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sS
\*Lgdssetup\*O [\*V-option\*O]
.nL
\*Lgdssetup\*O \*Vfilename\*O [\*V-option\*O]
.sE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.VL
.LI "\*L-h\*O"
Displays help information. 
.LI "\*L-l\*O\*Vfilename\*O"
Directs \*Lgdssetup\*O to write logging and error information to the specified
file. Error information is also duplicated in \*Lstderr\*O. If you do not
specify the \%\*L-l\*O option, no logging information is produced and error
information is directed to \*Lstderr\*O. 
.LI "\*L-o\*O"
Gives permission to \*Lgdssetup\*O to overwrite object attribute values where
necessary. 
.PP
If an object does not exist, \*Lgdssetup\*O will perform the necessary operation
(such as creating the object). If the object exists with an attribute that has
to be modified and the limit of attributes has been reached, \*Lgdssetup\*O will
not add the attribute.
.PP
The \*Lgdssetup\*O command will modify the attribute if the \%\*L-o\*O option
was set when \*Lgdssetup\*O was started. If more attributes are allowed,
\*Lgdssetup\*O will add the attribute. \*Lgdssetup\*O will only modify the
attribute if the \%\*L-o\*O option has been set.
.LE
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.VL
.LI "\*Vfilename\*O"
.nL
Specifies the pathname of a file if you use command line mode.  The
file must contain the appropriate input parameters and values as
described in the next section. \*Lgdssetup\*O processes the command as if you
entered them interactively. If you do not specify a pathname, the \*Lgdssetup\*O
command assumes that you want to use Interactive mode.
.LE

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \*Lgdssetup\*O command provides the administrator with an interface to
simplify the process of creating and initializing a directory
configuration.  The other method of creating and initializing a
directory configuration requires that the administrator perform
initialization steps by using the masks of the \*Lgdsditadm\*O program
either manually or by using batch file scripts (as described in Chapter 6.
.PP
Before starting the initialization of a DSA in an administrative
domain, the administrator of the new DSA should contact the
administrator of the initial DSA. The administrator of the new DSA
must make sure that the administrator of the initial DSA creates a shadow
of the entry at the root of the subtree that will hold the DN of the
new DSA. This shadow entry is required so that the administrator of
the new DSA can create objects under this root that make up the DN of
the new DSA.
.PP
The administrator of the contact DSA should set the \*LMaster-Knowledge\*O
attribute of this entry equal to the DN of the new DSA. In addition,
the administrator of the initial DSA should not set an ACL for the new
DSA, but leave this for the administrator of the new DSA. Otherwise,
the administrator of the new DSA will not have proper access rights to
create the entry for the new DSA. Refer to Chapter 6 for more
information on initializing a client/server system for an
administrative domain.
.SS "Modes of Operation"
.PP
You can run \*Lgdssetup\*O in either of the following modes:
.PP
.VL
.LI "Interactive"
Prompts the administrator to enter the required information. The amount of
information is a subset of the information required by using the \*Lgdsditadm\*O
program and is, therefore, substantially reduced. The administrator is not
required to have a complete knowledge of the initialization steps. The
\*Lgdssetup\*O program performs initialization steps automatically which
previously had to be specified explicitly by the administrator.
.PP
Every interactive setup session is recorded in a file with the name taken from
the environment variable \*LINTERACT_FILE\*O. If the environment variable is
not present, \*Lgdssetup\*O writes the information in
\*Lopt\*V/dcelocal\*L/var/adm/directory/gds/adm/gsu_setup_file\*O, using input
file format syntax so that the file can be used as the input file in command-line
mode.
.PP
The file is used in the next interactive setup session. The recorded answers to
the prompts are available by using the \*Leditline\*O and \*Lhistory\*O functions
provided by DCE. The \*Lhistory\*O output or the user input can be edited and
confirmed (by entering \*L?<RETURN>\*O). This feature can be very helpful because
a failed setup often needs only a few changes.
.PP
 
.LI "Command Line"
.nL
Takes a filename as an input parameter that contains keywords and values similar
to the prompts presented in interactive mode. This allows the administrator to
create configurations with minor modifications. The input can also be read from
\*Lstdin\*O.
.LE
.SS "Interactive Mode"
.PP
If you run \*Lgdssetup\*O in interactive mode, you are presented with prompts
that require the following types of data:
.PP
.ML
.LI
Configuration
.LI
Initialization
.LI
Administration
.LE
.PP
For most configurations, it is sufficient to use the defaults.
.PP
The first set of prompts requests configuration data:
.VL
.LI "\*LDir-id\*O"
.nL
The directory ID number.  The default is \*L1\*O. 
.LI "\*LConfig type (C/S)\*O"
.nL
Enter the configuration type: \*LC\*O for client or \*LS\*O for client/server.
.LI "\*LNo-of-clients\*O"
.nL
Enter the maximum number of clients that can access the directory at the same
time. The default is \*L16\*O.
.LI "\*LNo-of-servers\*O"
.nL
Enter the minimum number of server processes that can be active at the same
time. The default is \*L2\*O.
.LI "\*LSecurity method\*O"
.nL
Valid values are:
.BL
.LI
\*LDCE\*O 
.LI
\*Lsimple\*O
.LI
\*Lsimple\*O,\*LDCE\*O
.LE
.PP
Enter \*LDCE\*O if you want to use DCE authentication as the security method;
otherwise, enter \*Lsimple\*O. The default is \*LDCE\*O. If you want to use
both security methods, enter \*Lsimple,DCE\*O.
.LE
.PP
The next set of prompts requests that you enter initialization data:
.PP
.VL
.LI "\*LClient address\*O"
.nL
Enter the PSAP address of the client system. The default is
\*L"TS=client,NA='TCP/IP!internet=127.0.0.1+port=30010'"\*O.
.LI "\*LLocal-DSA name\*O"
.nL
Enter the DN of the local DSA.
.LI"\*LThe first default DSA is also the local DSA (yes/no)\*O"
.nL
Enter \*Lyes\*O if you want the local DSA to be the default DSA. 
.LI "\*LPSAP address\*O"
.nL
Enter the PSAP address of the local DSA.
.LI "\*LPrincipal name\*O"
.nL
Enter the principal name of the local DSA if DCE authentication is the
security method you specified earlier.  This prompt does not appear if
you specified \*LSIMPLE\*O.
.LI "\*LDSA-password\*O"
Enter the password for the local DSA. \*LDSA-password\*O is mandatory
for \*LSIMPLE\*O authentication, and optional otherwise.
.LI "\*LDefault-DSA name\*O \*Vn\*O"
.nL
Enter the DN name of the default DSA. You can enter one or more default
DSAs in the DUA cache. The DUA uses this information when an application
wants to make a bind to a default DSA. The \*Lgdssetup\*O command prompts
you for the DN of each default DSA and its PSAP address.
.LI "\*LPSAP address\*O"
.nL
Enter the PSAP address of default DSA \*Vn\*O.
.LI "\*LContact-DSA name\*O"
.nL
Enter the DN of the contact DSA. If the new DSA holds the shadow of the
schema object, the new DSA being configured is going to be in the same
administrative domain as this contact DSA. Otherwise, the new DSA starts
a new administrative domain. The contact DSA would be the source of the
schema object if the \*LUse default schema\*O parameter is set to \*Lno\*O.
This DSA will be contacted to initiate all searches that are performed
during the initialization process.
.PP
If this DSA name is not provided, it implies that the DSA being configured
is the first DSA in the directory world. This is referred to as the
\*Vinitial DSA\*O.
.PP
The \*Lgdssetup\*O command prompts you for the PSAP address of the contact
DSA (if you specified a contact DSA name).
.LI "\*LPSAP address\*O"
.nL
Enter the PSAP address of the contact DSA.
.LI "\*LLocal schema is master (yes/no)\*O"
.nL
Enter \*Lyes\*O if the local DSA is the master of the schema; otherwise,
enter \*Lno\*O. 
.LI "\*LUse default schema (yes/no)\*O"
.nl
Enter \*Lyes\*O if you want to use the default schema; if you enter \*Lno\*O,
the local DSA takes the schema from the contact DSA.
.LE
.PP
The last set of prompts requests administration information:
.PP
.VL
.LI "\*LAdditional-DSA name \*Vn\*O"
.nL
Enter the names of additional DSAs to which an application can bind. To
make a bind to one of these DSAs, the application must specify its DN
(unlike the defaults DSAs where the DN is not required as a bind argument).
This allows a client to directly bind to a DSA. 
.PP
For each additional DSA name, \*Lgdssetup\*O creates an object entry with
\*LPSAP-ADDRESS\*O as its only attribute in the DUA cache. The \*Lgdssetup\*O
command prompts you for the DN of each additional DSA and its PSAP address.
These DSA names will also be stored in the new local DSA so that they can be
used for chaining and referral.
.LI "\*LPSAP address\*O"
.nL
The PSAP address of additional DSA \*Vn\*O.
.LE
.PP
The following table shows how you should set parameters for the five types of
initializations described Chapter 6:
.PP
.na
.ML
.LI
Initial client/server system (that is, the first DSA in a distributed
directory system) (\*LCL-SV/Init\*O)
.LI
Client system (\*LCL\*O)
.LI
Client/server system with nonGDS DSAs, or DSAs that do not constitute an
administrative domain (\*LCL-SV/NoDom\*O)
.LI
Client/server system, local DSA, and initial DSA constitute an administration
domain and use the default schema (\*LCL-SV/Dom/Def\*O)
.LI
Client/server system, local DSA, and initial DSA constitute an administration
domain and do not use the default schema

When you specify a filename when you run \*Lgdssetup\*O, input is read
from a file.  You must create the input file by using a text editor and
include the prompts that would be generated automatically in
interactive mode by \*Lgdssetup\*O.
.PP
The following sample input files for typical client
(\*Lclient.init\*O) and client/server (\*Lserver.init\*O)
configurations are included as part of the GDS software and are
located in \*L/opt/\*Vdcelocal\*L/var/adm/directory/gds/adm\*O.

#			 (the DUA will try to bind to the first given DSA,
#			 only if this one is not available the DUA tries
#			 to go to the next default DSA in the list and so on)
#		       - remove the comments and replace the sample names 
#			 and PSAP addresses 
#		       - you can't give it if you want to configure the
#			 CL-SV/Init type
