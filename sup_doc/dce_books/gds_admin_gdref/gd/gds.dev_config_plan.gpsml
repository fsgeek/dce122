.H 1 "Developing a Configuration Plan" 
.iX "-[" "Global Directory Service (GDS)" "configuring"
.so gd/screen.mac
.P
Before attempting to initialize and configure the directory service,
the administrator must develop a configuration
plan that is specific to the environment in 
which the directory service will run 
and that meets the requirements of the users who will access the 
directory service. 
.P
This chapter includes configuration worksheets that an administrator 
can use to develop a configuration plan.  The list
of worksheets includes the following:
.ML
.LI
Cell worksheet
.LI
ACL Schema worksheet
.LI
ACL Object Entry worksheet
.LI
Shadow Entries worksheet
.LI
Client worksheet
.LI
Client/Server worksheet
.LI
Remote GDS and Non-GDS DSA worksheet
.LE
.P
...\" Appendix J 
Appendix F contains a set of worksheets that administrators can copy
for their own use.  Administrators are not obliged to use
every worksheet; they are provided to help
to organize the information required to initialize and
configure GDS and to make modifications at a later date.
.P
After filling out the worksheets, the administrator is ready to
perform a GDS configuration.  The next chapter describes how to use
this information to install and configure GDS.
.P
In order to explain how a typical administrator works through the 
configuration process, this chapter refers to a 
hypothetical branch administrator, Branch Administrator 4,
who is developing a plan to integrate a cell into GDS.
Branch Administrator 4 is setting up the directory service for a 
branch office of a large corporation, called the XYZ Corporation. 
The configuration consists of four
machines: two clients and two client/servers.  The two
client/server machines have the DSAs \*Ldsa-ops\*O and \*Ldsa-employ\*O.
.P
The initial DSA for the administrative domain containing
\*Ldsa-ops\*O is \*Ldsa-HQ\*O.  This DSA is
administered by the corporate network administrator, 
Corporate Administrator 1, who is located at corporate 
headquarters in a different city than Branch Administrator 4.
.P
The first-level DSA is administered by a global naming authority
(described in the following section) and is called
\*Ldsa-us\*O in this example.
.P
Developing a configuration plan involves the following steps:
.ML
.LI
Specifying the namespace organizations
.LI
Defining a cell in the directory
.LI
Specifying ACLs
.LI
Determining the number of machines
.LI
Determining client/server addresses
.LI
Defining non-GDS DSAs
.LE
.H 2 "Specifying the Namespace Organizations"
This section covers the following topics:
.P
.ML
.LI
Registering with namespace organizations
.LI
Determining the DNs of DSAs
.LI
Determining the need to modify the standard schema
.LI
Determining the need to modify directory IDs
.LE
.H 3 "Registering with Namespace Organizations"
.iX "-[" "cell names" "registering"
.iX "-[" "Directory System Agents (DSAs)" "registering names"
To enable a DCE cell to communicate with other cells in the global
naming environment, an administrator needs to obtain a globally unique
cell name.  The name either exists already or is specially created for this purpose.
To obtain a unique GDS cell name, an administrator contacts the other
administrator in charge of the section of the DIT
under which the cell is to be named.  In the United States, the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) delegates X.500 names subordinate to the entry /\*LC=US\*O.
.P
Administrators are encouraged to obtain
a unique global name for a cell even if the cell does not initially
use GDS to communicate with other cells.
This enables the cell to participate subsequently in a global naming
service. 
.P
In the sample configuration scenario, Corporate Administrator 1 in
charge of network operations for XYZ Corporation applies to ANSI
to reserve \*LXYZ\*O as a unique organization name.
Later, as one of the
first steps in establishing a cell, Branch Administrator 4 contacts Corporate 
Administrator 1 and asks to reserve the global name \*LBranch4\*O, which is used to
create a cell entry \*L/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4\*O in GDS.  Finally, 
Branch Administrator 4 again applies to Corporate Administrator 1 to reserve 
the names \*Ldsa-employ\*O and
\*Ldsa-ops\*O to establish the entry names for the two DSAs:
.ML
.LI
\*L/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4/CN=dsa/CN=dsa-employ\*O
.LI
\*L/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4/CN=dsa/CN=dsa-ops\*O
.LE
.P
If all directory requests that originate from \*Ldsa-employ\*O and
\*Ldsa-ops\*O remain within XYZ Corporation, Branch Administrator 4 
only needs to be registered with Corporate Administrator 1 (that is, within XYZ
Corporation).  In this case, Branch Administrator 4 makes sure that 
Corporate Administrator 1 at corporate
headquarters creates a shadow entry of \*Ldsa-employ\*O and
\*Ldsa-ops\*O on \*Ldsa-HQ\*O.  This way, Branch Administrator 4's 
DSAs can communicate
with other DSAs through \*Ldsa-HQ\*O.
.P
Branch Administrator 4 also needs to make sure that a shadow of 
\*Ldsa-HQ\*O is present on
\*Ldsa-ops\*O and \*Ldsa-employ\*O so that these DSAs can access other
DSAs in the XYZ Corporation.
.P
.ne 12
If Branch Administrator 4 expects the DSAs to participate in the directory service
outside of XYZ Corporation, \*Ldsa-employ\*O and \*Ldsa-ops\*O must be
known by DSAs outside of XYZ Corporation.  If shadow entries of
\*Ldsa-employ\*O and \*Ldsa-ops\*O exist on \*Ldsa-HQ\*O, most DSAs
can contact Branch Administrator 4's DSAs through \*Ldsa-HQ\*O.  
However, if Branch Administrator 4's
users need to access these remote DSAs frequently, 
Branch Administrator 4 should
consider contacting administrators of DSAs outside XYZ Corporation
directly and arranging for mutual shadow entries to be present on their
respective DSAs.  This would reduce the overhead of referrals and
chained requests over the network.  In addition, \*Ldsa-employ\*O and
\*Ldsa-ops\*O need to have a copy of \*Ldsa-us\*O (the first-level DSA)
to communicate worldwide.
.iX "-]" "cell names" "registering"
.iX "-]" "Directory System Agents (DSAs)" "registering names"
.H 3 "Determining the Distinguished Names of DSAs"
.iX "Distinguished Names (DN)" "for DSAs"
Each GDS entry is uniquely and unambiguously identified by a DN.
The administrator must determine the DN of each DSA in the cell (or
cells) that the administrator is responsible for in order to add these
DNs to the directory.  
.P
For example, Branch Administrator 4 knows that the DN for  XYZ
Corporation is \*L/C=US/O=XYZ\*O, and that the DN
of the cell is \*L/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4\*O.  Branch
Administrator  4 has applied for and received the names of the two DSAs:
\*Ldsa-employ\*O and \*Ldsa-ops\*O.  Therefore, the DN
of the two DSAs in the cell are
.ML
.LI
\*L/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4/CN=dsa/CN=dsa-employ\*O
.LI
\*L/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4/CN=dsa/CN=dsa-ops\*O
.LE
.P
Branch Administrator 4 also needs to determine the DN of other DSAs
(remote DSAs) in the network that users need to access directly,
and the DN of \*Ldsa-HQ\*O at XYZ corporate headquarters.  
Branch Administrator 4 can find out from
Corporate Administrator 1 that the DN of \*Ldsa-HQ\*O is
\*L/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=mainbranch/CN=dsa/CN=dsa-HQ\*O and 
the DN of \*Ldsa-us\*O is
\*L/C=US/O=ANSI/OU=first-level-dsa/CN=dsa/CN=dsa-us\*O. 
Branch Administrator 4 sometimes has to contact the administrators of other 
remote DSAs directly to find out
the DNs.  However, if Branch Administrator 4's DSAs can connect to
\*Ldsa-HQ\*O, they can read the DNs of all DSAs in the network from the DIB.
.H 3 "Determining the Need to Modify the Standard Schema"
.iX "schemas" "whether to modify"
GDS software is delivered with the GDS standard schema.  It contains
the directory classes and attributes specified in the X.500
standard, the GDS extensions, and, optionally, the electronic mail
package (X.400).  An administrator sometimes needs to add object classes
and attributes that are required by other applications to the schema.
.P
For example, Branch Administrator 4 decides to install a new software
package to monitor computer facilities.  This package
requires directory classes
and attributes that are not part of the current schema.  The new
program is being implemented across XYZ Corporation.  
Corporate Administrator 1 has set up the directory so that 
responsibility for administering
the schema resides at XYZ
Corporation headquarters (\*Ldsa-HQ\*O is the initial DSA and 
therefore masters the schema object).  Branch Administrator 4 cannot 
make any changes to the schema without
submitting a request to Corporate Administrator 1's  office.  
Branch Administrator 4
contacts Corporate Administrator 1 and 
provides the values for the entries in the
OCT, SRT, and AT for these new object classes and attributes.  
Corporate Administrator 1 adds the
new object classes and attributes to the schema.
.P
Corporate Administrator 1 also must use shadow administration 
functions to make sure that 
Branch Administrator 4 receives the schema changes in
the shadow of the schema object.
.H 3 "Determining the Need to Modify Directory IDs"
.P
.iX "directory IDs"
GDS allows an administrator to define multiple directory services by
using directory IDs.  This restricts access to an entire
DIT.  While this approach may be costly in
terms of additional overhead, it is an effective means of ensuring very
tight security or segregation of information by function where required.
.P
The XYZ Corporation can have more than one directory
service system.  For example, employee information can reside in one directory
service system and customer data in another.  
The branch network administrator needs to find out
from users if more than one directory service needs to be accessed.
.H 2 "Defining a Cell in the Directory"
.iX "-[" "cell names" "creating"
In order for a cell to be accessible in the global naming environment,
it must have a global name that is defined in the DIT and is
meaningful and usable from anywhere in the DCE naming environment. 
.P
The global name for the branch network administrator's cell, 
which is obtained from the corporate network administrator at corporate
headquarters, is \*L/.../C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4\*O.
.P
Branch Administrator 4 creates an entry for the
cell in the directory by using object administration.  In GDS, additional
cell information is contained in two attributes: \*LCDS-Cell\*O and
\*LCDS-Replica\*O.  The GDS object administration program provides
Mask 21 and Mask 22 for administrators to enter values for these
attributes. (See Chapter 8 for more information about object 
administration masks.)

a server manages more than one clearinghouse, and the 
clearinghouses are in different namespaces.
.P
A CDS UUID consists of 16 hexadecimal digit pairs represented as 8
hexadecimal digits followed by a hyphen, 3 groups of 4
hexadecimal digits separated by hyphens, a hyphen and 12 hexadecimal

UUID is used to check the validity of the clearinghouse.
.P
.LI
\*LClearinghouse Name\*O
.nL
Contains the full name of the clearinghouse in which a replica is stored.
This name is the name of a naming attribute that contains information
on the last known address of the clearinghouse.  This information enables
the creation of an RPC
binding to the server that maintains the
clearinghouse.
.LI
\*LTower\*O
.nL
The tower set of the server that maintains the clearinghouse.  A CDS tower
contains addressing information and information on protocols supported
by the clearinghouse server.  The format of the tower value,
which is the same format as a substring of the RPC string binding, is as follows:

Branch Administrator 4 needs to determine 
the access protection required for each
object in the directory at the attribute level to
ensure that unauthorized users cannot
read or modify attributes requiring some form of restricted access.
.P
Each attribute of an object is defined in the schema as having one of
the following access classes:
.ML
.LI
Public
.LI
Standard
.LI
Sensitive
.LE
.P
The administrator can change the access class of specific attributes
by using schema administration functions (described in Chapter 9).
.P
Each object in the directory has an ACL attribute that contains
values for the five access classes:
.ML
.LI
Modify Public
.LI
Read Standard
.LI
Modify Standard
.LI
Read Sensitive
.LI
Modify Sensitive
.LE
.P
\*LModify Sensitive\*O is the most restrictive category. \*LModify
Public\*O is the least restrictive of the five categories. \*LRead
Public\*O is, by definition, available to every user of the directory
service.
.P
These access classes are not related in a hierarchical order; they are
independent.  For example, if a user has modify rights for sensitive
attributes, this does not imply access rights for standard attributes.  Each
access right must be explicitly assigned.
.P
An administrator must also determine the access that users require for object
entries.  The administrator assigns directory users to the 
specific access classes by
entering their DNs in the mask provided in the object
administration program (described in Chapter 8).
.P
For example, the Personnel Department is responsible for the public
and private data associated with each employee of the branch office.
The personnel manager has given Branch Administrator 4
a list of information that should
be made available to all employees at the branch office.  This list
includes telephone numbers, fax numbers, and so on.  
The personnel manager requests that only certain people have
the ability to modify telephone and fax numbers in the directory.  Another list
contains information such as salaries, home addresses, and other
personal data that the personnel manager wants restricted so that 
the data can be read but not modified.
...\" Figure 14-2
.P
Figure 3-2 
shows the relationship between access classes as defined in
the schema and how user access class assignments affect access to a
specific object entry.  \*LFax-Telephone-Number\*O, \*LTelephone-Number\*O,
\*LStreet-Address\*O, and \*LAccess-Control-List\*O are attributes of the
object entry
\*L/C=US/O=US/OU=Branch4/CN=Jack Jones\*O.  The access classes
for the \*LFax-Telephone-Number\*O, \*LTelephone-Number\*O,
\*LStreet-Address\*O, and \*LAccess-Control-List\*O attributes have been defined
in the schema as \*LPUBLIC\*O, \*LPUBLIC\*O, \*LSENSITIVE\*O, and
\*LSENSITIVE\*O respectively.  The object entry has
the values of its \*LACL\*O attribute defined for Mary Smith, John Dulles,
and Jack Jones.
.P
As shown in Figure 3-2, Mary Smith has \*LMODIFY PUBLIC\*O and \*LREAD
SENSITIVE\*O access.  This means that
.P
.ML
.LI
She can read and modify the
\*LFax-Telephone-Number\*O and \*LTelephone-Number\*O attributes.
.LI
She can read, but not
modify, the \*LStreet-Address\*O and \*LAccess-Control-List\*O attributes.
.LE
.P
John Dulles has \*LMODIFY PUBLIC\*O and \*LREAD STANDARD\*O access.
This means that
.P
.ML
.LI
He can read and modify \*LFax-Telephone-Number\*O and
\*LTelephone-Number\*O attributes.
.LI
He cannot read or modify the
\*LStreet-Address\*O and \*LAccess-Control-List\*O attributes.

.P
Jack Jones has \*LMODIFY PUBLIC\*O, \*LREAD STANDARD\*O,

When setting up the access type for each user, 
Branch Administrator 4
considers the requirements of those people responsible for managing
specific information in the directory (such as the Personnel Manager).
.P
Branch Administrator 4 defines the access rights for specific users,
using Mask 6b of the Object Administration operations
to add them to the directory.

There are two types of ACL worksheets:

ACL Schema worksheet
.LI
ACL Object Entry worksheet
.LE
.H 4 "ACL Schema Worksheet"
.P
The ACL Schema worksheet contains a list of the access classes that
the administrator plans to assign for each attribute requiring a
change from the original value in the GDS standard schema.

...\" Figure 14-3
Figure 3-3 
shows a sample ACL Schema worksheet, which contains the
attributes and access class values that the 
branch network administrator wants to assign.  \*LSurname\*O
and \*LTelephone-Number\*O are \*LPUBLIC\*O 
so that all users can
read them; however, Branch Administrator 4
also wants the ability to restrict users from
modifying them for particular entries.  Attributes (such as
\*LUser-Password\*O) that Branch Administrator 4
does not want users to be able to read or
modify are assigned to the \*LSENSITIVE\*O access category.
.P
Branch Administrator 4 uses schema administration 
operations to make all the changes to the schema.

.iX "schemas" "setting ACLs"
.P
After GDS is configured, the ACL of the default schema has no access
rights.  This means that every user, including the anonymous user, has
read and write access to all attributes in the schema.  
The branch network administrator needs to
ask the corporate network administrator to change 
the ACL of the default schema (the corporate network administrator 
is responsible for the initial DSA 
\*Ldsa-HQ\*O) to only permit read and write access
to appropriate users.  Applications often require read access to the
schema.  The corporate network administrator needs to be 
the only one with write access to the schema.
.H 2 "Determining the Number of Machines"
.P
This section provides some guidelines to help an administrator gather
information and make decisions on various aspects of client and
client/server machines, DUA caches on each machine, and different
types of DSAs.
.nL
.ne 2.5i
.H 3 "Clients and Servers"
.iX "clients" "required number (GDS)"
.iX "servers" "required number (GDS)"
.iX "Global Directory Service (GDS)" "required clients and servers"
.P
An administrator must determine which of the machines in a cell are to be
clients and which are to be client/servers.  The number of client
machines in a cell depends on the number of users who need to
access a local DSA at the same time.  If this number is high, it is
worthwhile to include more than one client in the configuration plan.
.iX "Global Directory Service (GDS)" "determining the number of client/servers"
.iX "directory" "determining the number of client/servers"
The number of client/server machines depends on the number of DSAs
that are started when the directory service is activated.  Normally,
the optimal number of DSAs is two.  However, more DSAs are required if
one machine has to reply to a number of requests at the same time.
.P
For example, Branch Administrator 4 determines that the 
configuration for the branch office will
consist of two client/servers and two clients. 
Branch Administrator 4 also wants to have one
DSA running on each machine so that, if one goes down, users will have
uninterrupted access to other DSAs in the network.  The two DSAs are
called \*Ldsa-employ\*O and \*Ldsa-ops\*O.  \*Ldsa-employ\*O masters
all employee records for the branch; the \*Ldsa-ops\*O DSA masters other
data related to the daily operations of the branch.
.H 3 "Initial DSA"
.P
.iX "Directory System Agents (DSAs)" "initial"
An initial DSA masters the schema object.  An administrator must make
sure that there is a shadow of the schema object on each DSA that is
a member of an initial DSA's administrative domain.  
.P
The initial DSA 
in Branch Administrator 4's network
is \*Ldsa-HQ\*O, which is located at XYZ corporate headquarters.  This DSA is
administered by Corporate Administrator 1, who is responsible for
maintaining the schema.  Branch Administrator 4
must make sure that \*Ldsa-employ\*O and
\*Ldsa-ops\*O contain shadows of the schema object so that they can
become members of the administrative domain of \*Ldsa-HQ\*O.
.nL
.ne 2.5i
.H 3 "First-Level DSA"
.P
.iX "Directory System Agents (DSAs)" "first-level"
First-level DSAs are usually maintained by naming authorities at the
national level (such as the Deutsche Bundespost in Germany and ANSI in
the United States).  Typically, administrators only need to ensure that the
first-level DSAs in the network are either known to at least one of
the DSAs under their care or can be accessed by referral
through other DSAs in the network.  In the branch network administrator's 
case, \*Ldsa-employ\*O or
\*Ldsa-ops\*O needs to have a shadow entry of the first-level DSA
because, in the case of global requests, \*Ldsa-employ\*O or
\*Ldsa-ops\*O can try to chain an operation to the first-level DSA.
.H 3 "Master and Shadow Entries"
.P
.iX "-[" "objects" "master and shadow entries"
An administrator must decide which DSAs will contain master
entries and which will contain shadow entries.  If the most
up-to-date information is required, the user needs to obtain it
directly from the master.  In this case, the administrator must
keep the master entry on a machine close to users (avoiding network
access where possible).  If users at other sites require frequent access,
but the accuracy of the retrieved data is not time-critical,
shadows can be created at these other sites.
.P
An administrator also needs to determine how often shadows are
updated.  The frequency depends on user requirements and 
the types of applications that need access to the directory.
.P
For example, employee phone numbers do not change frequently.  If
employees within a small company do not change addresses that often,
the shadow update frequency could be low; for example,
daily or even weekly.  However, if XYZ Corporation is
experiencing explosive growth, and there are hundreds of thousands of
employees worldwide, shadowing would be required on a more frequent
basis.
.P
As a general rule, most entries in GDS do not require a high update
frequency.  Normally, shadow entries should be updated once daily.
However, if the directory service is used as a database, data tends
to change more frequently.

Figure 3-5
shows a sample Shadow Update worksheet partially filled out
by Branch Administrator 4.  The worksheet 
includes columns for the
DN of the object entry, the update frequency, and the
update times.  The possible values for the update frequency are
\*LHIGH\*O, \*LMEDIUM\*O, and \*LLOW\*O.  The values of the update
times depend on the update frequency (update times are in minutes for
\*LHIGH\*O, hours for \*LMEDIUM\*O, and a specific hour in the range
of days for \*LLOW\*O).

When entering a DSA object in

\*Ldefault\*O, or \*Ldefault/local\*O.
.P
For each of the clients, an administrator must determine which DSA is
the local or default DSA or both.  The default/local DSA (\*LDSA-Type\*O
\*Ldefault/local\*O) is typically the one located on the nearest machine
in the network.  More than one default DSA can be entered in the DUA
cache (\*LDSA-Type\*O \*Ldefault\*O).  This provides an alternative path to
the network if one or more of the other default DSAs cannot be reached.

In addition, the administrator needs to determine which other DSAs
(remote DSAs) the DUA needs to contact directly, and enter their

.iX "authentication" "updating the DCE Registry for GDS"
.iX "Global Directory Service" "DCE authentication"
.iX "Global Directory Service" "updating the DCE Registry"
Administrators are required to specify the authentication mechanisms
supported by a DSA when configuring the directory ID of the Directory
System.  GDS supports anonymous, simple authentication (requiring a
user's DN and a password) and DCE authentication.
.P
Administrators can use DCE authentication as a method to provide
additional security in accessing DSAs in the DCE environment.  Users
defined as principals in the DCE registry can be permitted or
restricted access to the Directory Service.  These restrictions can
apply to XDS applications that bind to specific DSAs during program
execution, to users logging into DSAs via the GDS administration
program's login facility and \*Lgdscp\*O, and to DSAs communicating
with other DSAs in the DCE environment.
.P
Refer to the \*(Dg for more
information on applying security features within an XDS application
program.  Refer to Chapter 7 for more information on how DCE
authentication affects user login to a DSA.
.P
The DCE Security Service provides a higher level of security than
Simple authentication mechanisms for the transmisssion
of a user's identity (DN) to the DSA during a \*Lbind\*O operation.  You
must enter the DNs of directory users and DSAs to the respective
principals in the DCE registry to make DCE authentication work.
.P
The DCE registry contains by default the following extended attributes
necessary for GDS if DCE authentication is enabled:
.P
.VL
.LI "\*LX500_DN\*O"
Contains the X.500 DN of a principal (user or DSA)
.LI "\*LX500_DSA_Admin\*O"
.nL
Contains a list of DSAs to which the principal is allowed to perform a master bind
.LE
.P
The \*LX500_DSA_Admin\*O attribute is only necessary for administrators
who are principals and only if the administrator of the DSA intends to
specify shadow update jobs.  In order to perform shadow updates,
\*Lgdsditadm\*O binds to all other DSAs that hold shadows of
information mastered by the local DSA.  You must specify the DNs of
these other DSAs in the \*Lrgy\*O attribute \*LX500_DSA_Admin\*O of
the administrator principal running \*Lgdsditadm\*O.
.P
Use the DCE \*Ldcecp\*O command to assign
a DN to existing principals.  Only principals with management
permissions can add or modify the values for the \*LX500_DN\*O and
\*LX500_DSA_Admin\*O attributes.
.P
For example, suppose a user logs into to the DCE as the principal \*Ljoe\*O and
wants to access the Directory as the X.500 user with DN of \*L/C=de/O=sni/OU=nm12/CN=joe,CN=miller\*O.  The administrator assigns the DN to the DCE principal
\*Ljoe\*O by using the following \*Ldcecp\*Ocommand:
.P
.ps 11
.vs 12
.oS
dcecp> \*Lprincipal modify joe -add {X500_DN {/C=de/O=sni/OU=nm12/CN=joe,
       CN=miller}}\*O
.oE
.ps 12
.vs 14
.P
Refer to the \*(Ar for information on how to use
\*Ldcecp\*O.
.P
Note that the example implies that the principal \*Ljoe\*O is already
known to the Registry.  Furthermore, the user represented by \*Ljoe\*O
needs an account to \*Ldce_login\*O before he can benefit from DCE
authentication within GDS applications.  This will most likely be the
case because, typically, users of DCE do not exclusively use the
Directory Service.
.P
If the user does not have an account and principal (which is most often true
for DSAs because they have to be introduced in the DCE Registry only for the
purpose of authentication), the Registry administrator must:
.AL
.LI
Choose a principal name (in the example it is \*Lgds-dsa1\*O).  This name gets
into the Directory as well as the \*LPN\*O attribute of the DSA.  The \*LPN\*O  attribute must be the global dce name and take the form:
.P
.oS
\*V/.../cell-name/dsa-principal-name\*O
.oE
.LI
Ask the administrator who maintains the DCE cell for this principal to apply
the following \*Ldcecp\*O commands:
.P
.ps 11
.vs 12
.oS
dcecp> \*Lprincipal create { gds-dsa1 }\*O

\*Cdcecp> \*Lprincipal modify gds-dsa1 -add {X500_DN {/C=re/O=sni/OU=buba
       /CN=dsa/CN=dsa1}}\*O

\*Cdcecp> \*Lgroup add groupname -member { gds-dsa1 }\*O

\*Cdcecp> \*Lorganization add orgname -member { gds-dsa1 }\*O

.nL
.ne 10
\*Cdcecp> \*Laccount create gds-dsa1 -group {groupname} -organization 
       {orgname} -password {gds-passwd}\*O 

\*Cdcecp> \*Lkeytab create keytabname -attr { {storage 
       /opt/dcelocal/gds_keystore} {data {gds-dsa1 plain 1 gds-passwd}}}\*O
.oE
.ps 12
.vs 14
.LE
.H 2 "Creating and Maintaining the Trusted DSA Table"
.P
The administrator can restrict authenticated access by specific DSAs
by creating and maintaining the Trusted DSA Table (TDT).  These
restrictions apply if a chained operation follows a bind
initiated by the intermediate DSA via the DCE authentication
mechanism.  Each table entry contains the DN of a DSA and permission
tags that define the type of access rights permitted for the DSA.
.P
The following permission
tags can be set for each DSA in the table:
.P
.VL
.LI "\*Lr\*O"
The \*Lread\*O, \*Llist\*O, \*Lsearch\*O, and \*Lcompare\*O operations chained by the DSA are treated as if the originator had performed a DCE authenticated bind.  All other operations are treated as if an anonymous bind had been performed.
.LI "\*Lm\*O"
The \*Lmodify entry\*O, \*Lmodify RDN\*O, and \*Lcompare\*O operations chained by the DSA are treated as if the originator had performed a DCE authenticated bind.  All other operations are treated as if an anonymous bind had been performed.
.LI "\*Lrm\*O
All operations are treated as if the originator had performed a DCE authenticated bind. 
.LE
.P
If the administrator does not specify a permissions tag for a TDT
entry, all operations chained by the DSA are treated as if
an anonymous bind had been performed.
.P
The administrator creates the file by using a text editor and saves it in
a file named
\*L/opt/dcelocal/var/directory/gds/dsa/dir\*E/dir-id\*L/dsatdt\*O.
For example, if the administrator wants to create a TDT file for the
DSA configured with a directory ID of \*L1\*O, the pathname of the TDT
file should be:
\*L/opt/dcelocal/var/directory/gds/dsa/dir1/dsatdt\*O.
.P
.ne 10
The administrator of the DSA \*L/C=de/O=sni/OU=buba/CN=dsa1\*O might
set up the TDT file as follows:
.P
.oS
/C=de/O=sni/OU=buba/CN=dsa,CN=dsa99:rm
/C=de/O=siemens/OU=zfe/CN=dsa05:m
/C=us/O=osf/OU=dce1.1/CN=gds_dsa:r
/C=iq/O=abc/OU=xyz/CN=suspect_dsa:
.oE
.P
After this sample TDT is created, if the target DSA
receives a DSP bind request via the DCE authentication mechanism,
the TDT check is switched on.  The intermediate DSA now chains the
operation.  The chained operation request contains the name of the
client (the X.500 user who bound the intermediate DSA).  This name is
referred to as the originator name.  The originator name is the only
name that is used by the target DSA to perform access control checks by
using the ACL attribute of the object involved in the operation.
.P
The following occurs depending on which DSA is the intermediate DSA:
.P
.VL
.LI "\*L/C=de/O=sni/OU=buba/CN=dsa/CN=dsa99\*O"
.nL
The originator name is used for access control decisions in every type of operation.  This means that the result of the access control check is the same as if the client had bound and authenticated directly to the target DSA.
.LI "\*L/C=de/O=siemens/OU=zfe/CN=dsa05\*O" 
.nL
The originator name is used for access control decisions in modify entry, modify rdn and remove entry operations.  This means that the result of the access control check for other operations is the same as if the client had bound anonymously to the target DSA.

.nL
The originator name is used for access control decisions in read, list 
search and compare operations.  This means that the result of the access control
check for other operations is the same as if the client had bound anonymously
to the target DSA.
.LI "\*L/C=iq/O=abc/OU=xyz/CN=suspect_dsa\*O"
.nL
The originator name is \*Vnot\*O used for access control decisions in any operation.  This means that the result of the access control check for every operations is the same as if the client had bound anonymously to the target DSA.
.LI "A DSA not contained in the TDT file list"
.nL
The originator name is \*Ealways\*O used for access control decisions in any operation.  This means that the result of the access control check for every operation is the same as if the client had bound and authenticated directly to the target DSA.
.LE
.P
If the TDT file does not exist, there is no restriction on chained
operations, except that the following message appears in the log file: \*Cno
TDT available\*O.
.P
The administrator can switch on the TDT feature by creating a
TDT file and entering the DSA that he or she does not trust to fill in
originator names correctly.

An administrator needs to determine the DN, DSA type,
PSAP address, and transport protocol information for remote DSAs that
users require access to.

...\" Figure 14-8 
Figure 3-8
shows how Branch Administrator 4 enters 
this information for each of the
remote DSAs \*Ldsa-remote1\*O and \*Ldsa-remote2\*O on the GDS 
Remote and Non-GDS worksheet.  
This information is
used to create the required entry in the DUA caches of the relevant
client and client/server machines.
