.H 1 "Subtree Administration"
.iX "-[" "subtrees" "administration"
.la E

.nh
..
The subtree administration functions allow the administrator to operate on a
subtree of the Directory Information Tree (DIT).  An administrator can use
these functions to manipulate a large number of objects belonging to a subtree
by using a single interface.  This chapter describes the interface and operation
of these functions.
.P
An administrator can perform the following subtree administration operations:
.ML
.LI
Save a subtree 
(object information taken from master DSAs or from a specific DSA) 
to a file (which could later be used in an \*LAppend Subtree\*O operation)
.LI
Append a saved subtree under the same node or under a new node on the same
or a new DSA
.LI
Copy a subtree from one node to the same node or to a new node on the
same or a new DSA (\*LSave Subtree\*O and \*LAppend Subtree\*O operations)
.LI
Change the name of a nonleaf node of the DIT so that name of the object and
of all the objects in the subtree are changed
.LI
Delete the subtree from the DIT
.nL
.ne 20
.LI
Change the master DSA for objects in a subtree (valid only for those objects of
a subtree that have master entries on the specified former DSA)
.LI
Change the attribute value for objects in a subtree that have the specified old
value for the attribute (\*LModify Subtree operation\*O)
.LE
.P
If an error occurs during execution of a subtree administration
function, the operation may not be completed and the DIT could be left
in an inconsistent state.  Administrators should make it a practice,
when a subtree administration operation fails, to check the state
of the DIT.
.P
Subtree administration functions have been implemented 
by using object administration functions, 
which makes their successful completion subject to access control.  
An administrator's credentials are established from the logon mask (Mask 1).  
In general, the administrator must have that following:
.ML
.LI
\*LREAD\*O access rights for all the attributes when an operation involves reading an
object (for example, the \*LSave Subtree\*O operation)
.LI
\*LMODIFY\*O access rights for the naming attribute(s) of a parent object
when adding an object (for example, the \*LAppend Subtree\*O operation)
.LI
\*LMODIFY\*O access rights for any attribute that is to be modified 
(for example, in \*LModify Subtree\*O and \*LAppend Subtree\*O operations)
.LE
.P
In summary, an administrator should have 
\*LREAD\*O access rights for all the attributes of all the 
objects of the subtree that involve the \*LSave Subtree\*O operation
and \*LMODIFY\*O access rights for all other functions.
.P
If an administrator is adding objects (implicitly) that exist in the
target subtree by using the \*LAppend Subtree\*O, \*LCopy Subtree\*O, or
\*LChange Name/Move Subtree\*O operations, and the attributes of the
target objects are different from the attributes of the source
objects, the list of such objects is displayed (in Mask 20) either as
overwritten or nonoverwritten objects.  
In Mask 17b (Additional Parameters (Part 2))
an administrator specifies if entries are to be overwritten.
.H 2 "Change Name/Move Subtree, Append Subtree, and Copy Subtree"
.P
The basic difference between \*LChange Name/Move Subtree\*O and
\*LAppend Subtree\*O and \*LCopy Subtree\*O is that \*LAppend
Subtree\*O and \*LCopy Subtree\*O operations retain the source subtree.
\*LChange Name/Move Subtree\*O deletes the source tree.  
.P 
Figure 11-1 illustrates the result of a \*LChange Name/Move Subtree\*O 
operation where \*L/C=US/O=Sales\*O is changed to \*L/C=de/O=Sales\*O.
.P
Figure 11-2 illustrates how a sequence of \*LSave Subtree\*O
and \*LAppend Subtree\*O works when a subtree is saved and appended under
the same parent node.

In Figure 11-2, the following occur:
.ML
.LI
The subtree whose root is \*L/C=US/O=Org1/OU=Dep1\*O is saved
to a file.
(\*L/C=US/O=Org1/OU=Dep1\*O must be specified as root of the subtree in Mask 6.)
.LI
The entry \*L/C=US/O=Org1/OU=Dep1/CN=McMahon\*O is then added.
.LI
The subtree is later appended under the same parent node.
(\*L/C=US/O=Org1\*O must be specified as the root of the subtree in Mask 6.)
.LI
The object with DN \*L/C=US/O=Org1/OU=Dep1/CN=McMahon\*O keeps
its \*LMaster-Knowledge\*O attribute, whereas the objects with the following
DNs take their \*LMaster-Knowledge\*O attributes from the save file:

.iX "\*Lappend subtree\*O operation"
The \*LAppend Subtree\*O operation appends a subtree from a file 
(created beforehand with the \*LSave Subtree\*O function) under a 
(new) parent node on a target DSA (original or different).
.P
In order to append the objects, the administrator must have modify access
to the naming attribute(s) of the root of the subtree.  The
administrator must also have modify
access to all attributes of all objects of the subtree.
(If the administrator does not have modify access, the operation fails to
append all objects or all attributes, or both.)
.P
In Mask 17b, the administrator can decide whether the appended
objects will keep their original ACL, or whether they will receive
the ACL of the new parent node.
.P
If the subtree is appended under a new parent, then the DSA where the
subtree is appended is the master of all entries that are added.
.P
If the subtree is to be appended under the same parent node from where
it is saved, objects to be appended that already exist keep the same
\*LMaster-Knowledge\*O attribute value.  Objects to be appended that do
not exist take the value of the \*LMaster-Knowledge\*O attribute from
the save file.
.P
An object that already exists under the (new) parent node is never deleted.
If such an object does not exist in the saved subtree, the object
is not affected by the operation.  If the object exists in the saved
subtree and has different attribute values, it is or is not overwritten,
depending on the selection made in Mask 17b.
.P
The new parent node under which the subtree is to be appended must
already exist as a master or shadow in the target DSA.
.P
In some cases, the \*LAppend Subtree\*O operation leads to the
creation or updating of optional
shadows.  It is the responsibility of the administrator to create
shadowing jobs for the shadows that are created by this operation.
If some shadows were created by Shadow Administration
operations and were updated by the \*LAppend Subtree\*O operation, 
the shadowing job
could fail for these shadows later.  These cases are illustrated in
the following examples.  Figure 11-14 shows two DSAs, 
\*LDSA1\*O and \*LDSA2\*O, before the \*LSave Subtree\*O operation.

Because shadows have been created on \*LDSA2\*O, the administrator
should create a shadowing job on \*LDSA1\*O for \*L/C=de\*O and its subordinates
with the target DSA as \*LDSA2\*O.
.P
The second example shows how the subtree under \*L/C=de/O=dbp\*O is
saved on \*LDSA1\*O and appended under \*L/C=us\*O on \*LDSA2\*O.  The
\*LC=us\*O subtree on \*LDSA2\*O was created by shadow
administration operations, and a shadowing job already exists for
it.

\*L/C=de/O=dbp/OU=dap11\*O, respectively, and not by a shadowing job.
The first two objects will be modified with attribute information
taken from the last two objects if the attributes of these objects are
different.  The shadowing job for these shadow entries will fail if
the shadows have been modified by this operation.  It is recommended
that shadows be created and updated by shadow handling
operations and not by \*LAppend Subtree\*O and \*LCopy Subtree\*O
operations.

After Mask 17b, Mask 20 is displayed because the object that has been copied

.iX "subtrees" "moving"
.iX "objects" "changing entry names"
The \*LChange Name/Move Subtree\*O operation changes the 
name of an entry (not necessarily an end node),
or moves a subtree.  This operation only changes master entries.
.P
If the name of a nonend node is changed, the new name is also valid for
its subordinate nodes.  The operation does not change any attributes of the objects
moved or renamed.
.P
In order to rename or move the objects, the administrator must have
modify access to the naming attribute(s) of the parent nodes and to all
attributes of all objects of the subtree. (If the administrator does
not have modify access, the operation fails to rename or move all
objects or all attributes, or both.)
.P
If an object or subtree cannot be renamed or moved completely, the old
object or subtree is retained.
.P
The new parent node must already exist as a master or shadow.
.P
Objects that already exist under the new parent node 
that also exist in the old subtree are overwritten or not overwritten,
depending on the selection made in Mask 17b and whether these
objects also exist in the old subtree.  Objects in the new subtree
that do not exist in the old subtree are not affected by the
operation.
.P
The \*LChange Name/Move Subtree\*O operation typically deletes shadows
of the old subtree on certain DSAs and not on others.  The shadow
update job fails for the shadows that have been deleted.
Administrators should run the shadowing jobs once for the shadows
that have not been deleted and delete shadowing jobs for the old
subtree.  Figures 11-20 and 11-21 show the subtrees on three DSAs before
and after a \*LChange Name/Move Subtree\*O operation where \*L/C=us\*O
is changed to \*L/C=in\*O.

The shadowing job for \*L/C=us\*O (and its subordinates) for
\*LDSA2\*O will fail.  The administrator should run the shadowing job
for \*LDSA3\*O and then delete the shadowing job.  The administrator
should also create a shadowing job for the \*L/C=in\*O subtree for
target DSA \*LDSA2\*O because shadows have been created by the
\*LChange Name/Move Subtree\*O operation.  Shadows and a shadowing job
for the new subtree should be created for target \*LDSA3\*O if the new
subtree is to be known on that DSA.

\*L/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4/CN=dsa/CN=dsa-doc\*O is the object's new (changed) DN.
.LI
\*L/C=US/O=XYZ/OU=Branch4/CN=dsa/CN=dsa-employ\*O is the DN of the current DSA.

The \*LChange Master\*O operation changes the \*LMaster-Knowledge\*O 
attribute of objects
of a subtree.  Only those objects 
that have the specified old value for the \*LMaster-Knowledge\*O attribute 
are affected by this operation.
Therefore, objects that are master entries in the subtree
now become shadows of master entries on another DSA (new
master DSA).
.P
Before changing the \*LMaster-Knowledge\*O attribute of a subtree, the
administrator must ensure that shadow entries exist for all the
entries of the subtree in the new master DSA.
.P
The administrator must have modify access to the \*LMaster-Knowledge\*O
attribute of all objects where the attribute is to be changed.
.P
Once a \*LChange Master\*O operation is complete, the administrator
must ensure that shadowing jobs that update the shadows on other DSAs
(other than the new master DSA) are run once.  Shadowing jobs that
update shadows on the new master DSA will fail because those shadows
will already have been updated by the \*LChange Master\*O operation.
Shadowing jobs for old master entries on old master DSAs should be
deleted.  In addition, shadowing jobs should be created for new master
entries on the new master DSA.
.P
Figures 11-25 and 11-26 show three DSAs (\*LDSA1\*O, \*LDSA2\*O, and

The \*LModify Subtree\*O operation modifies the

of the subtree are checked and the number of hits are reported.  You 
must have modify authorization for the attribute to be modified
