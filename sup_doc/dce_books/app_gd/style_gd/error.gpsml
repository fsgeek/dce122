.H 1 "Errors and Messaging"
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
...\" 
.P
Applications should adopt a consistent and portable error handling style. This
includes methods for returning errors from remote procedure calls, generation of
application-specific status codes, and the generation and display of error text.
This chapter recommends a set of techniques for handling all of these issues.  The
chapter also makes recommendations about error logging for applications that choose
to use the logging facilities.
...\" 
...\" 
...\" 
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.H 2 "Error Handling"
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
...\" 
.P
By default, the RPC runtime generates exceptions for RPC remote and communications
errors.  However, the default exception handler dumps core, which is not a very
useful client response to such errors as failure to connect with a server that is
down.  Although the default error handling model attempts to treat an RPC call as a
single continuous thread, propagating server errors back to the client, it will
probably be more useful for most applications to contain the effects of server
errors on the server side of the application.  In this model, the client will output
an error message when, for example, the server dumps core.
.P
Thus, it is recommended that applications establish some explicit error handling
mechanism for RPC calls.  The \*EAES/DC\*O recommends the use of status returns as
being a more portable way of handling errors than using exceptions.  This
recommendation is also consistent with the error-handling model for the RPC API.
...\" 
...\" 
.P
You can have remote calls' communications and remote runtime errors reported through
a status parameter by specifying the \*L[comm_status]\*O and \*L[fault_status]\*O
attributes for the calls in the 
application's \*L.acf\*O file.  The IDL compiler does
not require that a status parameter be explicitly declared in the interface declaration,
since it will add such a parameter implicitly.  The \*Lcomm_status\*O and \*Lfault_status\*O
parameters are not really part of the remote interface: they are supplied by the client
stub as one way of handling remote exceptions.
.P
However, server managers need 
to report application-specific errors as well.  Although
such errors can be reported through function return values or a separate application
error status parameter, the most consistent method is to use a single status parameter
to report all errors.  In this way a client need not concern itself with two or three
separate error parameters, and can use a consistent error handling scheme for both API
and application RPC errors.  In order to return application-specific errors, such a
status parameter must be part of the IDL specification of the interface.  The recommended
method is therefore to declare a \*Vstatus\*O parameter as part of the application's
\*L\&.idl\*O file declarations, and then add the \*L[com_status]\*O and \*L[fault_status]\*O
attributes to the parameter by declarations in the \*L.acf\*O file.
.P
Of course, if application and DCE runtime errors are to share the same status
parameter, they must use disjoint error number spaces.  The DCE messaging facilities
provide a means to do this.
...\" 
...\" 
...\" 
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.H 2 "Messaging Facilities"
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
...\" 
.P
The need to acquire an error number space is related to the larger issue of messaging
in general.  Applications typically need messages both for error reporting and for other
status reporting and informational purposes.  The recommended practice is to use messages
catalogs for all messaging.  
.PP
.ne 10
Message catalogs permit applications to deal with messages
as numerical constants and to keep all associated text separate from the application itself.
This is especially important for internationalization requirements; applications deal
only with generic error numbers; locale-specific message text is kept in separate
catalogs.
.iX "message catalogs"
.P
Message numbers are partitioned by technology, component, and code. The technology
and component fields select a message catalog, and the code indexes messages within
a catalog.
...\" 
...\" (See RFC 24.2 for details.)
...\" 
The requirement to have a unique application-specific error number space can be met by
adopting a unique component field within a given technology.  To facilitate this, OSF
makes component numbers available in two ways.  
...\" 
...\" 
.AL
...\" 
.LI
Within the \*Ldce\*O technology (the default core component technology field used by
DCE implementations), OSF sets aside two
...\" 
...\" Correct?
...\" 
components guaranteed not to be used by DCE implementations.
...\" 
.LI
OSF sets aside an ISV technology and maintains a registry of component numbers
which may be assigned to ISVs.
...\" 
.LE
...\" 
...\" 
.P
This makes two levels of uniqueness available to applications. An \*Eunregistered\*O
application can guarantee that its message number space does not conflict with that
of DCE implementations or of any registered ISV components by using one of the
reserved component numbers within the \*Ldce\*O technology space.  This does not, of
course, guarantee that the application's message number space does not conflict with
that of other unregistered applications.  This is a sufficient guarantee only for
applications that do not communicate or share application-specific message catalogs
with other unregistered applications.  For example, the client side of an unregistered  
application may encounter error number conflicts if it makes RPCs to the server side
of an application that uses an overlapping error number space.
.iX "unregistered applications"
...\" 
.nS note
A related restriction on such non-registered applications is that they must
install their message catalogs in some application-specific place.  Since message
catalog names depend on component numbers, other applications may be using the
same message catalog names.
.nE
...\" 
.P
Applications that need to guarantee a unique error number space among all DCE
applications should use a registered component number obtained from OSF.
...\" 
...\" What's the procedure?
...\" 
This is the recommended procedure for applications that have public interfaces
that are likely to be called by other applications.
...\" 
...\" 
...\" 
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.H 3 "DCE Errors and DCE Messages"
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
...\" 
.P
An application that wishes to use the DCE message facilities must organize all
of its message text into a separate file which is compiled by the \*Lsams\*O
utility to generate a message catalog.  The result of the \*Lsams\*O compilation
is that a set of DCE-consistent, application-specific codes for all the messages
(not only errors) is generated.  Use of the DCE facilities thus guarantees that
application-specific status codes will be disjoint from those used by DCE for
\*Lfault\*O and \*Lcomm\*O status values, and for API calls.  The application can
then use exactly the same error handling and reporting strategy for application RPC
calls as for API calls.
.iX "\*Lsams\*O utility"
...\" 
...\" It is recommended that applications use \*Ldce_svc_printf(\|)\*O to display
...\" error messages.  
...\" The sample application in Appendix A illustrates this approach.
...\" 
.P
Of course, generating the message catalogs is only one aspect of using the DCE
facilities.  The DCE routines that access the message catalogs to output the
messages must also be used.
...\" 
...\" 
...\" 
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.H 3 "DCE Application Message APIs"
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
...\" 
.P
Message generation by distributed programs can be divided into two broad kinds:
...\" 
.ML
.LI
Normal (often user-prompted, client-generated) messages
.LI
Server event messages, containing information about server activity,
either normal or extraordinary
.LE
...\" 
.iX "message generation"
.P
Similarly, DCE makes available to applications two messaging APIs:
...\" 
.ML
.LI
The DCE messaging interface
...\" 
.LI
The DCE serviceability interface
...\" 
.LE
...\" 
.P
The DCE serviceability interface is designed specifically to output messages
of the second (server event) type.  Messages in the first category can be
output using the DCE general purpose application messaging routines.
.P
.ne 10
Although the two interfaces, broadly speaking, do the same 
general thing (that is,
write messages), their functionality was designed to serve different needs,
both of which occur in most distributed applications.  Nevertheless, either
interface can be used more or less exclusively of the other, if desired.
Both interfaces use message catalogs (for the most part) to generate output;
the catalogs themselves are generated by \*Lsams\*O during compilation, as
mentioned earlier.
...\" 
.P
The following sections describe some aspects of using the serviceability
interface.  Full discussions of both interfaces can be found in
...\" (``DCE Application Messaging'') and 4 (``Using the DCE Serviceability
...\" Application Interface'') in the
the \*(Dk.
...\" 
...\" 
...\" 
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.H 2 "Serviceability and Logging"
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
...\" 
.P
The DCE serviceability facilities allow server applications to display or log
messages, to control message routing, and to associate actions with messages.  A
remote serviceability interface also makes it possible to control server message
routing and filtering via \*Ldcecp\*O or from application management clients.
...\" 
...\" It is recommended that all 
...\" error and informational message text be displayed or
...\" logged via the \*Ldce_svc_printf(\|)\*O call.  At the most basic level,
...\" \*Ldce_svc_printf(\|)\*O can be used to as substitute for \*Lprintf(\|)\*O to
...\" display message catalog text at the terminal.  
...\" With little additional work, the
...\" application can also add elaborate message logging and routing.
...\" 
...\" 
.iX "serviceability"
...\" .nS note
...\" The use of the messaging facility does not 
...\" require the use of the serviceability
...\" interface to display or log messages.  The messaging interface can be used to
...\" extract messages directly from catalogs via the 
...\" \*Ldce_msg_get_msg(\|)\*O call.
...\" Applications can also use the \*Ldce_error_inq_text(\|)\*O to retrieve text
...\" associated with error messages created within the 
...\" DCE error numbering scheme.  Such
...\" messages can then be displayed or otherwise 
...\" handled by applications as they see
...\" fit.  However, the serviceability interface 
...\" is the recommended means for handling
...\" error message text.
...\" .nE
...\" 
...\" 
.P
The serviceability mechanism is designed to be used mainly for server informational
and error messaging\(emthat is, for messages that are of interest to those who
are concerned with server maintenance and administration (in the broadest sense of
these terms).  The essential idea of the mechanism is that all server events that
are significant for maintaining or restoring normal operation should be reported in
messages that are made to be self-documenting, so that (provided all significant
events have been correctly identified and reported) users and administrators will by
definition always be able to learn what action they should take whenever anything
out of the ordinary occurs.  User-prompted, interactive, client-generated messaging
should be handled through the DCE messaging interface.
.P
Serviceability is also used by the DCE components (for example, 
DTS, CDS, and so forth) themselves.
Consistent use of the same message mechanism by DCE implementations and applications
should result in simplified DCE administration.
.P
.ne 10
DCE components use the serviceability facilities according to the following
guidelines; it is recommended that DCE applications use them also.
...\" 
...\" 
...\" 
.ML
...\" 
.LI
All servers should report when they are started, and when they have completed
their initialization and are ready to perform work.  They should also indicate
when they are going off-line.
...\" 
.LI
All program exits should be reported as fatal errors.  Similarly, all calls to
\*Labort(\|)\*O should be replaced by calls to \*Ldce_svc_printf(\|)\*O with
the \*Lsvc_c_action_abort\*O action attribute specified.
...\" 
.LI
Errors which make it impossible for the application to proceed should be reported
as close as possible to the point of occurrence.  This includes such
conditions as: failure to allocate memory, failure to open a configuration file for
reading, or a log file for writing, and so on.
...\" 
.LI
Conditions which may indicate system-level malfunction or poor performance must
be reported.
...\" 
.LI
Routine administrative actions should be reported as informational messages.  This
includes: creation, modification and deletion of tickets, threads, files, sockets,
RPC endpoints, or other objects; message transfer, including name lookup, binding,
and forwarding;
...\" 
...\" directory maintenance, including caching, 
...\" advertisting, skulking, and replication;
...\" 
and database maintenance, including replication or synchronization.
...\" 
.LE
...\" 
...\" 
.P
The severity level attribute for each message can be determined according to the
following criteria:
.iX "severity level attribute"
...\" 
...\" 
.ML
...\" 
.LI
Fatal error exit (\*Lsvc_c_sev_fatal_error\*O).  An unrecoverable error has occurred
requiring special manual recovery actions to take place, such as database restoration.
The program usually terminates immediately.
...\" 
.LI
Error detected (\*Lsvc_c_sev_error\*O).  An unexpected event that is nonterminal or is
correctable via human intervention has occurred, such as a timeout.  The program continues
although some functions or services may not be available.  This may also be used to
indicate that a particular request or action could not be completed.
...\" 
.LI
Correctable error (\*Lsvc_c_sev_warning\*O).  An error occurred that was automatically
corrected, such as a configuration file was not found so that defaults were used.  This
may also be used to indicate a condition that may be an error if the effects are
undesireable, such as removing all files when a nonempty directory is removed.  This
may also be used to indicate a condition that if not corrected will eventually result
in an error, such as when a printer is running out of paper.
...\" 
.LI
Informational notice (\*Lsvc_c_sev_notice\*O).  A predetermined major event has occurred,
such as a server started.
...\" 
.LI
Verbose information notice (\*Lsvc_c_sev_notice_verbose\*O).  A predetermined event has
occurred, such as a directory entry was removed.
...\" 
.LI
Debug level 1 (\*Lsvc_c_debug1\*O) through debug level 9 (\*Lsvc_c_debug9\*O).  Messages
in the nine debug levels would not normally appear in production code.
...\" 
.LE
...\" 
...\" 
.P
An appropriate action may be associated with an error message by ORing one of the
\*Lsvc_c_action. . .\*O values with the message attribute.  Note that the
\*Lsvc_c_action_abort\*O action, which results in a call to \*Labort(\|)\*O, does
not provide any reliable means to clean up and should only be used where the default
\*Labort(\|)\*O action, which is typically to dump core, is appropriate.  Cleanup for
the \*Lsvc_c_action_exit\*O action can implemented by supplying an \*Latexit(\|)\*O
handler.
.P
In addition to these guidelines, a persistent server application that does message
logging should consider exporting the remote serviceability interface as a means to
simplify server administration.
...\" 
...\" [Need to add this to the sample code.  It's very simple.  Doug has an
...\" example.]
...\" 
...\" 
...\" 
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.H 2 "Sample Code"
...\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
...\" 
.P
The sample server application source compiles a message catalog as well as the
required auxiliary \*L.c\*O and \*L.h\*O files from a \*Lsams\*O file.  In part,
the file looks like the following (for the full file, see Appendix A):
