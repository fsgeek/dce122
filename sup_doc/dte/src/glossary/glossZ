|.TERM|zombie process
|.ACR|
   |.DEFIN|1|A terminated process whose entry remains in the process table,
but to which a user or kernel space is allocated. A process becomes a zombie
process when it issues the \s12\f(HBexit\s12\fH system call and the following
circumstances occur. Its parent process is not executing a
\s12\f(HBwait\s12\fH system call and has not set its \s12\f(HBSIGCLD\s12\fH
signal action to \s12\f(HBSIG_IGN\s12\fH indicating that it does not intend
to wait for its children to finish.
