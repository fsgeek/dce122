Contents

    Glossary data files whose names are of the form "glossA", where 'A'
    is a letter of the alphabet.  All non-alphabetic terms go in the
    file "gloss@".


Below is the format of the glossX files.  The words in upper case are
REQUIRED keywords, lower case is example.  Also see the glossary man page
(glossary.4).

Some notes:
  o Multiple definitions are designated by numbers.
  o Each TERM has at most one acronym (ACR).  If there is none, the empty
    field must remain.
  o A definition may span several lines.
  o For each DEFIN (definition) there must be at least one entry for XREF,
    BOOK, and TOPIC even though the entries are blank.
  o Each definition may "belong" to many books, meaning that the term
    will appear in each of those books.  Similarly, each definition may
    belogn to many topics.
  o There may be multiple entries for each XREF, BOOK, and TOPIC.  Simply use
    multiple lines as shown above.
  o If a TERM has an XREF, but no DEFIN, use "*" for the definition.
