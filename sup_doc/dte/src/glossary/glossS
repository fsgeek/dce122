|.TERM|security classes
|.ACR|
	|.DEFIN|1|A means of classifying levels of security.  The
National Computer Security Center (NCSC) defines a set of security
classes, ranging from A to D (with gradations within each class).  The
criteria for the general classes are as follows:
.VL
.LI "\*LA\*O"
Verified protection
.LI "\*LB\*O"
Mandatory protection
.LI "\*LC\*O"
Discretionary protection
.LI "\*LD\*O"
Minimal security
.LE
.PP
Within each class are subclasses, indicated by a number, with higher
numbers indicating higher security.  That is, C2 offers more
security than C1, and B1 offers more than C2.  The classification is
hierarchical, meaning that each class includes all the features of the
previous classes.  The significant levels for OSF/1 configurations are C2
and B1.  The C2 level contains the following features:
.ML
.LI
Individual password controls and auditing of security related events
.LI
Access controls "capable of including or excluding to the granularity
of a single user."\*F  OSF/1 fulfills this requirement using ACLs
.FS \*ETrusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)\*O
(CSC-STD-001-83), U.S. Department of Defense, National Computer
Security Center, August 15, 1983. Section 2.2.1.1.
.FE
.LI
Object reuse protection, ensuring that data left in memory, on disk,
or elsewhere is not accessible to inappropriate users
.LE
.PP
The B1 level contains the following features:
.ML
.LI
Mandatory access control
.LI
Rigorous separation of security-related portions of the system from
those portions that are not related to security
.LI
Additional testing and documentation, including a model of the
security policy supported
.LE
.PP
The next level, B2, requires additional assurance that the system
cannot be penetrated.  Some of the features required at B2 are already
in place in OSF/1.  For example, OSF/1 supports the requirement of
\*Eleast privilege\*O, which stipulates that users and programs
possess the least number of privileges possible, and for the least
time necessary to perform operations.

interface with the database to retrieve, insert, and delete tags
