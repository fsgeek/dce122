Contents

    install-ref.sh	This install procedure for installing refpages.

    *.dirlist		Files that contain a list of directories where the
			files to be installed reside.  The name of this
			file typically is the osf offering.  Directories
			are listed one per line and are relative to a
			common root of the offering's doc tree.

    *.links		Files that contain a list of man files to "link"
			together (for multiple refpages in the same file,
			such as grep/egrep/fgrep).  Files to "link" are
			listed one per line and 2 columns, the first col
			is the existing file, the second the link to create.


This program, install-ref, installs OSF reference page files (for the
man command).

Processing

    Certain processing must be done for the man command to be able to deal
    with the files.  Amongst these are:

    + Process through "tbl", since most versions of the man command do not
	do this automatically.
    + Process through "eqn", for same reason (OSF reference pages do not
	have equations, so the default is to not process with eqn).
    + Expand certain troff strings used (for references to OSF books).
    + Remove conditional code (#ifdef's), optionally processing for B1 or
	C2 security levels (OSF/1 books).
    + Remove boxes from tables, since most versions of nroff do not allow
	reverse vertical movement.
    + Optionally insert of copy of the SML macros into each man file, or
	a reference to them (via ".so" troff directives).  SML macros are
	required for the output to appear properly.

Requirements

    These programs must be in your search path:
	rmifdef, rmboxes, tbl, eqn

    Additional files required:
	<offering>.dirlist - list of directories (relative to doc root) where
			     files to be installed reside
	<offering>.links   - list of "links" to make in directories (each line
			     is of the form "man1/vi.1 man1/view.1") [ if
			     desired ] May be an empty file.

    Information required:
	Path to root of doc source tree.
	Path to SML macros directory
	Path to man installation (target) directory.

    Also needed:
	Write permission to man page destination.


Command line flags and options

    Here is a summary of the most common flags to install-ref (from
    "install-ref -help":

      -doc DIR      root of documentation tree
      -offering OFF use config files for offering OFF (osf1, dce, motif, dme)
      -sml DIR      directory where SML macros live [default $DTE_LIBDIR]
      -man DIR      path of destination man heirarchy [default /usr/share/man]
      -smart        smart mode - try to find defaults for args not specified
      -so           insert ".so" for SML macros into installed man files
      -insert       insert copy of SML macro files in each man file
      -solink       use .so for duplicates in multple-command man file [default]
      -hardlink     use hard links for duplicates in multple-command man file
      -tbl CMD      name of tbl command, or "none" for none [default "tbl"]
      -eqn CMD      name of eqn command, or "none" for none [default "none"]
      -B1           filter for B1 level security (osf1)
      -C2           filter for C2 level security (osf1)
      -hacktables   Hack certain tables to fit in 80 column display (Motif only)
      -duptables    Hack certain tables to fit in 80 column display in nroff
                    but use all 5 columns in troff (Motif only)
      -expand       Expand certain filenames if not on a system with 14-char
                    filename limit (Motif, generally)
      -suffix       Simplify suffixes to single digits.  E.g. abc.1X -> abc.1
      -v            verbose mode - shows progress of procedure
      -V            more verbose mode - shows more details of progress

    You can also set environment variables to control some behavior.  Below
    is a list of variables that can be set to determine what programs to run
    or what directories or other information to specify.
    To not run a command, set the value to "none".

	Variable	Default
	RMIFDEF		rmifdef
	TBL		tbl
	EQN		none
	RMBOXES		rmboxes
	MKWHATIS	/usr/lbin/mkwhatis or /usr/lib/makewhatis
	CATMAN		/usr/sbin/catman or /usr/etc/catman

	DOCROOT		None.  Can be used in place of "-doc" arg.
	MANDIR		None.  Can be used in place of "-man" arg.

Where to put the SML macros?

    OSF reference pages require SML macros.  There are several
    possibilities.  One is to insert a copy of the macros in each man file. 
    This takes more space, but the man file will work anywhere, even if the
    SML macro directory is moved or deleted.  If the ".so" approach is
    taken, the SML macro directory must be available from wherever you run
    the man command from.  This is not possible at all site configurations.


Running install-ref

    If you run install-ref with no arguments, it will ask you for all
    necessary information.  If you specify some argument, it should only ask
    for what it needs.  If you specify "-smart", it will take its best guess
    at many things, trying to not ask any questions.  It is more convenient
    to specify as much on the command line as possible, using "smart" mode.

    The following command will install the DCE man files into
    /usr/local/man.  The source files reside in subdirectories under
    /top-of-dce-doc-src; the file dce.dirlist is consulted for the list of
    subdirectories.  The SML macro files are looked for in
    /installed-dte/libdata/macros.

	install-ref -offering dce -doc /top-of-dce-doc-src -insert \
		-sml /installed-dte/libdata/macros -man /usr/local/man -smart


A Note for Motif Reference Pages

    There are a few specialized options for certain tables in Motif reference
    pages.  The basic issue is that some 5-column Motif tables are too wide
    for 80-character wide terminal windows when viewed with the man command.
    The option "-hacktables" will adjust these tables so that each row of 5
    cells is broken into 2 rows of 3 and 2 cells.  It's not perfect, but they
    are viewable.  The option "-duptables" will do this when formatted with
    nroff, but will use all 5 columns when formatted with troff ("man -t"
    on many systems).

    Motif is the only offering that takes into consideration systems with
    14-character filename limits.  All files shipped have names that are 14
    or fewer characters.  However, many of the names of Motif commands
    and interfaces (library calls) are longer.  The "-expand" option will
    make install-ref expand the filenames to the full name.  (This full name
    is gleaned from the .TH line of the source file.
