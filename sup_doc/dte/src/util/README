Contents

    add-cutmark.sh	Program to shrink pages to the size of OSF books (as
			published through Prentice-Hall) and add cutmarks.
			Intended for "publish" style, not "draft".

    check-gloss.c	Checks the format of a glossary database file.  Prints
			error messages if it finds something wrong.  Useful for
			people editing glossary database files.

    check-iX.sh		Checks for errors in index (.iX) markup in source files.

    check-lists.sh	Checks for errors in lists markup in source files.

    check-oSoE.sh	Checks for errors in system output area (oS/oE) markup
			in source files.

    check-xref.sh	Checks for consistency cross references in reference
			pages.  Best if run from a set of installed ref pages
			(e.g. from /usr/share/man).

    print-eps.sh	Moves EPS files away from the lower-left corner and adds
			the filename for  more convenient viewing/printing.  The
			DTE wants EPS figures to be oriented in the lower-left
			corner.

    ix-density.1	Program to report the denity of index entries
    ix-density.sh	throughout a book.

The DTE requires nothing in this directory.  These are simple utilities
to make life easier.
