     This document provides an overview of the security services
     present in the OSF DCE 1.0 environment.  The material in
     this overview is collected from the various security specif-
     ication made availble to the OSF and from design notes and
     discussions that have been distributed to the osf dce-tech
     mailing list.

     The goal of the OSF DCE is to provide a transparent distri-
     buted computing environment in which users and applications
     can access the same set of resources from any connected com-
     ponent.  While the DCE removes the obstacle of physical or
     logical distance from accessing an object, it does not
     intend to remove the ability of an object's owner to deter-
     mine who is authorized to access that object.  The DCE secu-
     rity services provide an authorization system that provides
     a mechanism for determining access rights to objects and an
     authentication system that provides trustworthy identifica-
     tion of the individuals involved in network operations.

     The DCE security services consist of a variety of cooperat-
     ing services. The user registration service manages user,
     group and account information and provides login services to
     individual machines.  The authentication service allows
     principals defined as accounts in the user registration ser-
     vice to exchange credentials and establish mutually authen-
     ticated communications.  Authorization services are provided
     by the combination of a privilege server that constructs
     privilege attribute certificates that capture privileges
     currently available and selected by a principal and an
     access control list facility.

     The DCE provides a set of federated distributed computing
     environments.  When viewed from the perspective of the nam-
     ing or file system, these environments are referred to as
     c_e_l_l_s_.  A cell is characterized by the following properties:

     o+ High Connectivity - The computer systems in a cell have a
       greater degree of connectivity with each other than with
       systems not in the cell.

     o+ Unified Naming Environment - a cell defines a single nam-
       ing environment. Operations which must operate between two
       cells or between a cell and some other environment (e.g.,
       Domain Name System/BIND, X.500) may provide slightly dif-
       ferent semantics around services, security and schema
       enforcement.

     From the security perspective a r_e_a_l_m_ defines an analogous
     administrative unit to the cell.  A realm is characterized
     by the following properties:

     o+ Shared Trust - each principal in a realm shares a secret
       with the realm's authentication service.  It is this
       shared secret and the common trust in the realm's authen-
       tication service that allows two principals to authenti-
       cate to each other without previously sharing a secret.

     o+ Common Administration - A single replicated service pro-
       vides the repository for user's principal and account
       information.

     o+ Simplified Principal Naming - The realm name for the local
       realm may be omitted from a principal name.

     While the concepts of cell and realm are independent they
     share many management problems and strategies.  In the DCE
     we equivalence the two concepts so that when the term cell
     is used it will also imply a single realm to which that cell
     belongs and when the term realm is used it will imply a sin-
     gle cell associated with that realm.  To be consistent with
     other DCE components, the term cell is used in preference to
     realm except for when a distinction is to be made between
     the security and other DCE components or when discussing
     Kerberos (from which the term realm arises).

     The central role of the security services is to manage the
     community of users within a given realm.  In the DCE this
     problem is primarily in the representation of identity and
     the certification of that identity to applications running
     on independent systems in the environment.  Some local sys-
     tem functions are also provided in the effort to preserve
     the location transparency of the distributed environment.
     By supplanting the conventional machine login and account
     management utilities with replacements that consult the net-
     work user registry, users are free to use any system in the
     environment provided that the local administrator has not
     restricted access. In this way systems become shareable
     resources akin to objects in the file or name system.

     In the DCE a principal's identity is composed of two parts,
     an identifier for the principal and an identifier for that
     principal's realm.   This two part identification allows the
     identity to be used both inside the principal's realm and at
     any other realm.

     Identifiers are in turn composed of two components, a U_U_I_D_
     (Universal Unique Identifier) and a printstring name.  The
     UUID provides the definitive representation of a principal's
     identity.  The prinstring name is available to assist brows-
     ing tools and for use by human users when specifying a par-
     ticular principal.

     Principal identities are strucutred in this way to allow the
     printstring name to change without having serious impact on
     the DCE.  Names are not static - society encourages name
     changing during certain rituals so the computing environment
     should be prepared to gracefully handle these changes.  In
     the DCE principal identifiers are scattered throughout the
     global environment. Identifiers appear on access control
     lists (ACLs) which are both pervasive through and persistent
     in the system.  Not only do these identifiers appear on too
     many objects to be feasible to scavange, they appear on
     objects that exist only on archival media.  These issues
     lead us to the model that uses unchanging UUIDs as the
     definitive representation of a principals identity.

     In the general model of the DCE as an open network of sys-
     tems integrated into a public global network, unauthenti-
     cated access to resources seems to be an anathema.  Experi-
     ence with systems comparable to the DCE at universities such
     as CMU have shown that the use of even weak authentication
     yields a flammable environment.  The combination of publicly
     specified protocols and physical access to networks proved
     to be a temptation to great for undergraduate hackers to
     ignore.

     There are, however, certain environments where the added
     efficiency of removing cryptographic integrity checks are
     worth the extra physical security that must be instituted.
     These environments typically are not connected to the global
     network - and if they are they do not support DCE services
     to systems outside their physical control.  In addition to
     physical security, these environments place a great deal of
     explicit trust in the people who have access to the systems.
     The use of discretionary access control in an unauthenti-
     cated system has to be viewed as a convenience feature for a
     community that is following strict etiquette or which is
     only interested in the prevention of accidents.  The operat-
     ing assumption has to be that anyone and everyone can choose
     to access any object in the system in any mode.

     While it is not the recommended mode of operation, the DCE
     security services do provide the mechanism for unauthenti-
     cated access in the system.  The access control facility
     allows an object's acl to contain an entry which expresses
     that unauthenticated identities will be accepted and that
     determines the maximum access rights to be afforded to
     accesses made on the behalf of asserted rather than authen-
     ticated identities.  The authenticated RPC facility has the
     complementary feature which allows identities to be asserted
     rather than transmitted via cryptographic authentication
     protocols.  Other DCE services such as the naming and file
     systems can be configured to take advantage of these
     features.

     Within a cell the privilege server and the authentication
     server are trusted services that certify a principal's iden-
     tity and privileges.  Applications trust that these services
     are properly secured, and believe the certificates generated
     by these services because the cerificates are sealed in part

     under a key that is private to the application's principal.
     When authenticating principals from a foreign realm more
     mechanism is needed.

     Cross-Cell authentication is relies on two features, the
     ability to place principals from foreign realms on access
     control lists and the ability to construct a PAC sealed in a
     ticket for a service in a foreign realm.

     ACLs contain a list of entries that identify principals and
     their associated rights to an object.  Identification for a
     principal consists of two components, the principals's iden-
     tifier, a UUID, and an identifier for the principal's cer-
     tification authority (realm) (a hierarchical name).

     Reference monitors grant access to objects by comparing an
     identity sealed in a PAC with the identities in ACLs.  The
     PAC represents the initiator's identity and group privileges
     with identity pairs that identify the principal/group and
     authority - analogous to the way these identities are
     represented in ACLs.

     When allowing principals from foreign realms on an ACL, an
     application is forced to trust services other than just the
     local realm's authentication and privilege server.
     Minimally the application must also trust the authentication
     and privilege server from the initiating realm to certify
     the initiator's identity.  In addition the cells' authoriza-
     tion services must be able authenticate each other so that
     applications can rely on the foreign certificates.

     Trust in the local realm is dependent on a key shared
     between the authentication service and the principal.  A
     foreign realm does not possess this secret, instead it
     shares a different secret with the local realm.  This
     secret, the inter-realm key, is used to allow principals
     from the foreign realm to obtain tickets to the local realm.
     Trust is established between realms that either share
     inter-realm keys or between which exists a sequence of
     realms that share inter-realm keys.  In the DCE transitive
     trust is limited to those realms which directly share
     inter-realm keys and to inter-realm sequences that form a
     well defined hierarchy.

     Allowing realms to establish authenticated communications by
     sharing a key is comparable to the mechanism used to allow
     principals to establish authenticated communications.  And,
     as is the case with principals, it is too cumbersome for
     each realm to have a shared secret with every other realm
     with which it may need to interact.

     The authentication service provides the solution to the
     scaling problem for authenticated communication between
     principals in a cell, but no comparable service can resolve
     the problem for realms.  If such a service existed, it would
     be difficult to imagine realm administrators from indepen-
     dent organizations agreeing to a common repository for the
     key distribution service.  Even in public key based systems
     it is hard to imagine realm administrators agreeing to an
     external agent controlling the key for the global certifica-
     tion authority.

     Transitive trust allows the use of a chain of point-to-point
     authentication steps using shared keys between each link.
     This avoids both the space complexity of managing keys for
     every realm a given realm may communicate with and the unac-
     ceptable creation of a global authority.  Unrestricted tran-
     sitive trust, however, is as dangerous as a global author-
     ity.  Subverting a single realm will allow an intruder to
     masquerade as any other realm - the intruder need only con-
     struct a dummy realm for the intended victim and then use a
     transitive trust path that passes through the compromised
     realm.

     Imposing a hierarchical structure on the transitivity of
     trust allows potential damage to be contained.  The follow-
     ing diagram depicts a portion of the naming tree.  The nodes
     .../com/hp, .../com/dec, and .../com/apple are cell roots
     that correspond to the root realms for the corresponding
     companies. Subordinate to these nodes are other cell roots
     (realms) that correspond to organizational structures of
     each company.

     The goal is to allow realms to act as intermediaries for
     other realms while preventing this extension of trust from
     subverting the entire global environment.  Compromising a
     realm should not result in compromise to realms that are
     unrelated to the realm.  Damage should be restricted to
     objects subordinate to that realm and possibly to objects in
     other realms that are open to access by principals in the
     subverted realm or its subordinates.  For example,
     Compromising the apollo realm should not result of comprom-
     ise to any data in the apple realm except possibly for data
     that is available to principals in the apollo realm and for
     data stored in the apollo realm.  A small number of rules
     governing the transitivity of trust provide these features.

         1) A Peer Realm is trusted to certify principals from
         that realm.

         2) Realms are trusted to certify descendent realms.

         3) Ancestor realms are trusted to certify any realm they

         trust.

     These rules allow us to construct an environment as depicted

     This figure depicts ancestral/descendant relationships with
     the token "^" and peer trust relationships with a dashed
     line "- -".  In this figure any principal in any realm at HP
     can trust other principals at HP and at DEC;  any principal
     at DEC can trust principals from DEC and HP;  principals at
     apple can only trust other principals at apple.  Trust
     between principals at DEC and HP exists if the HP and DEC
     realms were involved in the certification process.  Subver-
     sion of the HP realm allows an attacker to impersonate any
     legitimate HP principal to any realm inside HP or DEC except
     for the principal's actual realm.  It also allows the
     attacker to impersonate any principal from any other realm
     (e.g., an apple realm) to realms inside HP.  This attack,
     however, does not allow the attacker to impersonate another
     realm (e.g., apple) to DEC.

     The following diagram shows a different trust model between
     the companies. Instead of a high degree of trust at the
     upper level of the organization, there is a more limited
     degree of trust established.  The com/hp/ma/apollo realm
     shares keys with the com/dec/lkg and the com/apple/mac
     realms.  In this scenario principals at apollo can interact
     with principals at lkg, lkg/rpc and mac.  Principals at lkg
     and lkg/rpc, however, cannot interact with principals at
     mac.

     Subversion of the apollo realm creates havoc inside the
     apollo realm and allows the intruder to impersonate apollo
     principals to lkg, lkg/rpc and mac.  This attack however
     does not allow principals at lkg or lkg/rpc to interact with
     princpals at mac.  This is because neither lkg nor mac are
     descendents of apollo - they are simply peer realms.

     Subversion of the lkg realm will allow the attacker to
     impersonate any realm and principal combination to its des-
     cendent lkg/rpc, but it will only allow attacks on objects
     protected for lkg and lkg/rpc principals in the apollo
     realm.

     ticket-granting  ticket  requests.   The initial  ticket
     portion  is   sometimes referred to as the Authentication
     Server (or   service).    The   ticket-granting ticket por-
     tion is sometimes referred  to as  the  ticket-granting

     An encryption key shared by a  principal and  the  KDC,
     distributed  outside the bounds of the system, with a long
     lifetime.   In  the  case  of a human user's principal, the
     secret  key  is  derived from a password.

     6_.2_6_.  s_e_a_l_

     To encrypt a record containing  several fields  in  such  a

     knowledge  of the encryption key or leaving evidence of
     tampering.

     6_.2_7_.  s_e_s_s_i_o_n_ k_e_y_

     An encryption key provided to two principals for the purpose
     of encrypting communications between them; its lifetime  is
     limited to the duration of a single  communications session.

     6_.2_8_.  t_i_c_k_e_t_

     An application-transparent mechanism that transmits the
     identity of an initiating principal to its target. A simple
     ticket  contains  the principal's identity,  a  session
     key,  a timestamp,  and  other  information, sealed using
     the target's  secret  key. A privilege ticket contains the
     same information as a simple ticket, and also includes a
     privilege attribute certificate.  A ticket-granting ticket
     is ticket to the ticket-granting service; a service ticket
     is a ticket for a specified service other than the ticket-
     granting service.
