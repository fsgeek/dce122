This directory contains the subdirectories that contain the PostScript
output files that make up the OSF DCE Technical Supplement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Technical Supplement is not a wholly OSF-built document like the
other DCE books. For the most part, it consists simply of all the rele-
vant Functional and Design Specifications for the DCE components as
supplied to OSF by the components' providers, mostly in PostScript
form, and passed on by OSF to the DCE licensees as if they were all in
one big DCE book. OSF surrounds the original miscellany of PostScript
files with the other output files that one would expect for a built book.

This is the DCE 1.0.2 version of the apparent complete output book that 
is shipped on a DCE tape. Most of these files are the DCE functional and 
design specs which reside here unchanged from the form in which we received 
them from the DCE providers.
