This directory contains sources for Distributed File Service (DFS)
application programming documentation.  It contains both guide
documentation and reference pages.  Before DCE 1.1, this material was
part of the OSF DCE Application Development Guide and the OSF DCE
Application Development Reference.

The file drafterrorinfo.gpsml contains DFS error code information that
has been compiled for the Problem Determination Guide (PDG).  It is
incomplete and unreviewed; therefore, it will not be contained in the
PDG.  However, it is deemed of value and is therefore made available
here.
