This archive intends to deliver the scope of the qualification testing
performed on R1.2.2 prior to GA submission.

The complete test reports (test results), as supplied by the Providers who 
performed the testing, are collected and presented in the TestSummary file.

test-logs (for the tests named in the TestSummary file).

	     and hclcfg001.
