The two subdirectories here contain the test-logs resulting from the
"smoke testing" performed at OSF on the final GA Baselevel. 

Smoke testing at OSF focused on the CORE and the DFS components; the DFAM
component was tested more thoroughly by the Provider who developed the
component.

DFS test logs are provided here; CORE smoke tests were run, but generated no 
test logs.
