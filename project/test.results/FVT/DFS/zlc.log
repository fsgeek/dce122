Running test cases...
------------------------------------------
Running invocable component: localdelete
Regression test: Test basic ability to delete a file in glue path.

creating /testmnt.15975/testfile.15975
deleting /testmnt.15975/testfile.15975
invocable component returned PASS status
------------------------------------------
Running invocable component: dfsdelete
Regression test: Test basic ability to delete a file in DFS.

creating /.:/fs/zlc.15975/testfile.15975
deleting /.:/fs/zlc.15975/testfile.15975
invocable component returned PASS status
------------------------------------------
Running invocable component: loccrdfsopen
Create a file locally, open it through DFS, remove file
locally, then read file through DFS. This basically tests the
ability to keep around a file after its linkcount has gone to 0.
It is a regression test.

creating /testmnt.15975/testfile.15975
opening /.:/fs/zlc.15975/testfile.15975 through DFS
deleting /testmnt.15975/testfile.15975
invocable component returned PASS status
------------------------------------------
Running invocable component: dfscrlocopen
Create a file through DFS, open it locally, remove file through
DFS, then read file locally. This basically tests the ability
to keep around a file after its linkcount has gone to 0. It is
a regression test.

creating /.:/fs/zlc.15975/testfile.15975
opening /testmnt.15975/testfile.15975 through local path
deleting /.:/fs/zlc.15975/testfile.15975
invocable component returned PASS status
------------------------------------------
Running invocable component: movefileset
The idea behind this test is to open a file, delete the file,
move the fileset, then try to read the contents of the file.
This is testing whether the zlc code is properly handling moved
fileset containing zero linkcount files. To make sure the CM is
not just reading a copy of the file from its cache, the file is
actually created through the glue path.

creating /testmnt.15975/testfile.15975
opening /.:/fs/zlc.15975/testfile.15975 for later read
deleting /.:/fs/zlc.15975/testfile.15975
moving fileset zlcmove.15975
fileset zlcmove.15975 moved
invocable component returned PASS status
output: Fileset 0,,2381 moved from /.../power2.dce.transarc.com/hosts/power2 epi0 to /.../power2.dce.transarc.com/hosts/power2 epi1
output: Fileset 0,,2381 moved from /.../power2.dce.transarc.com/hosts/power2 epi1 to /.../power2.dce.transarc.com/hosts/power2 epi0
------------------------------------------
Running invocable component: remotemovefileset
The idea behind this test is to open a file, delete the file,
move the fileset, then try to read the contents of the file.
This is testing whether the zlc code is properly handling moved
fileset containing zero linkcount files. To make sure the CM is
not just reading a copy of the file from its cache, the file is
actually created through the glue path. This test differs from
the previous one in that the move is across machines.

creating /testmnt.15975/testfile.15975
opening /.:/fs/zlc.15975/testfile.15975 for later read
deleting /.:/fs/zlc.15975/testfile.15975
moving fileset zlcmove.15975
fileset zlcmove.15975 moved
invocable component returned PASS status
output: Fileset 0,,2381 moved from /.../power2.dce.transarc.com/hosts/power2 epi0 to /.../power2.dce.transarc.com/hosts/power8 epi0
------------------------------------------
Shutting down...
Cleanup called
fileset zlcmove.15975 removed from aggregate epi0
