This was fixed by either OSF or HP edits.  The fix is 
editorial in nature, so I have canceled this bug instead of going 
back and checking out the file to add a change bar.

The following comes from the original comments to CR 13244, which
was duped to 13377 (marked "fix"). The particular defect described
below seems still to be present. The original description comes
from Maria Wadlow at Transarc; it is followed by my own (bracketed
and indented) comments, made after 13244 was duped to 13377.

              "dts" should be not in uppercase, but in bold,

	The last paragraph in the description of the "directory
	remove" command would be better placed at the beginning.
	The initial description is very sparse and the reader
	won't know what the command really does until they read
	the last paragraph, so it might be better to provide
	that information earlier.

            [Not enough context is given here for me to be sure, but it
             looks like the text has not been changed. The initial descrip-
             tion is still very sparse, and the final paragraph still gives
             what appears to be the main use for the operation.]

[6/21/96 public]

   There is nothing wrong with the text or the order of the
   information in the 'directory remove' command.  Note there
   is no bug or complaint about the order of information in
   the 'directory add' command, which is in the same order as
   the information presented here.

	Some of the possible arguments are not defined, for example,

             ately following. But three other arguments are explained there.
             However, the omitted arguments are explained in the relevant
             operations' separate sections later on.]

[6/21/96 public]

   The ARGUMENTS section is meant only to define those attributes
   that are direct arguments to the command, NOT attributes that
   are passed to the command via options.  So, a look at the
   'directory' command shows only three true arguments.  They
   are directory_name_list, operation and source_directory_name.

   All three of these are properly defined in the ARGUMENTS section.

   The rest of the attributes are all passed in via options, so are
   defined in the OPTIONS section within each command.

   Cancelled.

        "It also requires the user to be authenticated to the dce
        security service as the cell administrator."
        There is no requirement that a cell have a cell administrator
        account.  This might be better worded, "It also requires that
        the administrator possess the privileges typically associated
        with the cell_admin account."

             [This statement is still present.]

[6/21/96 public]

   The current sentence "...authenticated to the dce security
   service as the cell administrator." is not incorrect, and is
   not necessarily better as suggested in this bug.  This sentence
   does not directly say that cell_admin, as an account, has to
   exist, only that a user must have cell administrator capabilities
   to run the command.

   This wording, 'must be the cell administrator' is sprinkled
   thoughout dce documentation, not just in the dcecp manpages, and
   is clear enough.

   Cancelled.

   Yes it is.  In the 'DESCRIPTION' part of the cdsalias command itself
   is the following text:

      attribute must be set to 4.0 or greater.  See the ATTRIBUTES section

					and elsewhere

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.


             [The -attribute flag for account create is missing an
              open bracket, apparently.]

[6/21/96 public]

   The synopsis section for all commands has been normalized.
   There is no bracket missing from the 'account create' synopsis,
   or from any other 'account' commands, for that matter.  The
   synopsis:

   account create account_name_list
   -mypwd password
   -password password
   -group group_name
   -organization organization_name
   [-attribute attribute_list |
   -attribute value]

   is correct as written.

   Cancelled.

The following comes from the original comments to CR 13230, which
was duped to 13377 (marked "fix"). The particular defect described
below seems still to be present. The original description comes
from Maria Wadlow at Transarc; it is followed by my own (bracketed
and indented) comments, made after 13230 was duped to 13377.

[CR 13230, duped --> 13377] ATTR STILL PRESENT
0021            tech    ComRef  1-12    man8dce/account.8dce

        The "postdatedtkt" attribute is not implemented.
        The "proxiabletkt" attribute is not implemented.
        The "renewabletkt" attribute is not implemented.
        The "maxtktrenew" attribute is not implemented.

             [These attributes are all still present. This
              may be in fact correct, but I have no way of
              knowing whether it is or not.]

[6/21/96 public]

   In the current version of the manpages, the 'dupkey',
   'postdatedtkt', 'proxiabletkt' and 'renewabletkt' attributes
   all have the following text:

      In DCE this attribute is currently only advisory.  However,
      Kerberos clients and servers will make use of it when they
      interact with a DCE Security server.

   The 'maxtktrenew' text is correct as written.

   All these attributes are fully functional in dcecp.  What exactly
   security does with them may be in question, but that is for security,
   or the admin guide to handle.

   Cancelled.

[13247, duped --> 13377]

	"You must have  permission to the /.:/hosts directory in CDS."
	First, no permissions are listed in this sentence as it
	appears.  Second, no special permissions are required to
	perform the "host catalog" command.

               [This seems to be two separate complaints. I can't find
                the passage quoted at the beginning (which seems to
                be what the first complaint is about). The "Privileges
                Required" section for "host catalog" does claim that
                you need r (read) permission on /.:/hosts to success-
                fully execute the operation, and I take that to be the
                target of the second complaint. The change hasn't been
                made there.]

[6/20/96 public]

Funny how seemingly unrelated bugs connect...

OT13485 was recently opened to reflect the fact that 'directory list'
does not correctly identify the user, thus allows unrestricted access,
when it should make a call to do_sec_login() before the actual work is
done.  This, among other things, is being fixed in the HP drop to 1.2.2.

Once this fix is in place, the 'directory list' command will need the
permission that is listed in it's manpage (read access to the directory).

Because 'host catalog' uses 'directory list', the user will need read access
to '/.:/hosts' (the directory being listed) for the command to succeeed.

               "13377" change markers with the notation "clarified

This is a code bug, not a doc bug.  OT13325 was opened to cover
the problem, and it has not been fixed.  When the code change is
made, the synopsis will be correct.

        Is the "[info library]" reference ever described anywhere?
        This should be "dceshared/tcl."

              [Change hasn't been made.]

[6/20/96 public]

   No.  The 'info library' command is from tcl, and we don't get into
describing tcl commands in detail anywhere in the dcecp manpages.  Also,
the output from this command is site-dependent...

      dcecp> info library
      /opt/dcelocal/tcl
      dcecp>

So hard-coding the output from this command is wrong.

The manpage for dce_printf gives dce/dce.h as the required header file.
In fact, this function is declared in dce/dce_svc.h.

[3/15/96 public]
I was too hasty - dce.h #includes dce_svc.h, so I'm cancelling this OT.

This chapter begins with:

  "The DCE remote procedure call (RPC) component provides 
  two administrative facilities: the RPC daemon
  and the DCE RPC control program, \*Lrpccp\*O. 

  These facilities are superceded by the DCE host daemon (\*Ldced\*O)
  and the DCE control program (\*Ldcecp\*O) in OSF DCE Version 1.1." 

The references and the superceded 
commands have been left in the DCE documents, but 
annotated with notes such as the one above.  
Until a decision is made to delete the outdated 
commands from the documents, I believe the manpage is 
correct as stands.  I am canceling this bug.

I guessed at the priority.  The IDL encoding services introduced a
datatype called "idl_size_t".  This is just an alias for size_t, and
as such should be removed.  Replace all idl_size_t's (if any) with
size_t.

[10/12/95 public]

The idl_size_t type appears in both the following RPC manpages:

    rpc_ss_allocate.3rpc
    rpc_ss_set_client_alloc_free.3rpc
    rpc_ss_swap_client_alloc_free.3rpc

...and in the "Interface Definition Language" (i.e., IDL) chapter
of the Application Guide core book.

[11/2/95 public]

In the related CR 13144, the following comment was made:

  (viv 10/6/95)
  idl_size_t is not a type that is used as an RPC parameter. Its use
  is to allow for the proper prototype for malloc in the memory
  management APIs. There is no ndr representation for it. Therefore,
  idl_size_t should be documented as such.

--which makes it appear that the "idl_size_t" references should
remain as they are. Anyway, I'm updating this CR and assigning
it to HP.

[11/02/95 public]
I read Bob's note, which is really an internal porting issue.
I still think size_t is what should be used.

[8/13/96 public]
According to developers at HP, idl_size_t is not exactly an alias for 
size_t.  It is a data type defined in idl.base.h, which is included in the 
routines cited above.  I've changed this CR to cancel.

Willie, I'm cancelling this because it was just a test.  Thanks.

The dcecp specification (RFC42.3) list of changes (Section 1.1) lists the
following item which is not contained in the OSF DCE Command Reference:

       (dm) Added a `-xattrs' option to `principal', `group',
            `organization' and `registry show' operations.  Some also get a
            `-all'.

The '-xattrs' option has not been added to the registry object. It HAS been
added to all of the other objects listed above.

[1/19/96 public]

As far as I could determine, the items mentioned above were not
included in the November dcecp drop from HP, so no changes were
made in connection with this CR to registry.8dce.

I reassigned responsibility to Pam Millett, who is about to do
some further work on manpages.

[1/19/96 public]

There is no -xattrs option in any registry command.
It was not implemented.

[1/19/96 public]

I was asked and was wrong at first so I'll comment here.
Jim is correct.  -xattrs was added to principal, group, and organization.
The dcecp I'm running (HP Aug 95 code) has them.

There is no -xattrs on the registry show command.  RFC 42.3 incorrectly
says that there is.  I believe the reason was that rgy-wide ERAs (that 
were I think to be stored on the policy object) were never implemented.
If they ever are, then the registry show command should have a -xattrs
option added.

There is no 'operations' attribute on the server object.  There
is an 'operations' action, and that is documented.

There is no '-binary' option on any 'server' command.  There is
also no 'data' attribute.  Both these exist on the 'hostdata'
command, and are fully described in the hostdata manpage.

Likewise for the following macros:

Many of those functions are deliberately not part of the public API.
For example rpc__XXX, the thread pool stuff (see OT CR 10218), and
perhaps the exception-related stuff.

Updated subcomponent field.

DCE 1.1 Admin Guide Core section 19.2.2 refers to cdscp. In DCE 1.1 
cdscp has been replaced by dcecp and therefor, the doc should be 
corrected to use dcecp and the example should show like,

# dcecp
dcecp> cdscp show clerk

[8/30/95 public]

I'm cancelling this bug, for 1 1/2 reasons: (a) Since the command
programs are still present in 1.1, mention of them in the docs is
not incorrect per se, and (b) it happens that "show clerk" is one
of the cdscp subcommands for which there is no dcecp mapping; so in
this case the cdscp information has to be retained as is.

Remove reference to pre-processor variable, OSFCDS_REFERRALS,
 from the Porting and Testing Guide.  The software does not build 
correctly when this is defined.  It appears that XDS switching
between GDS and CDS is not and will not be provided.  

Below is the question received from a customer.

==============================================================

From: Chen Xiao Liang (CEC) <chen@ssaws.yk.fujitsu.co.jp>

Hello, I am Chen, one of the member of Fujitsu DCE Porting Group.
I have some questions about the GDS pre-processor variable OSFCDS_REFERRALS.

It is written in 'DCE Porting and Testing Guide' that if OSFCDS and 
OSF_CDS_REFERRALS are not defined, the switch-support is not built in GDS.
  "Original: If OSFCDS and OSF_CDS_REFERRALS are defind The DUA checks to 
   see if it should be referring an operation to the CDS instead, and if so, 
   calls CDS through the DUA switch code. Otherwise, no switch suport is 
   compiled into GDS."

However, OSF_CDS_REFERRALS is not used anywhere in GDS sources.

Note: Instead of OSF_CDS_REFERRALS, OSFCDS_REFERRALS is used.

We corrected Makefile to define OSFCDS_REFERRALS and executed make,
but the error was reported and make was stopped.

  The error was "function d21_cds_referral() was not found."

  This symbol is defined at dua/switch/d21_cds_ref.c, but we show 
Makefile existed at dua/switch, d21_cds_ref.c is not in the list of 
compilation objects.

  Therefore, I have some questions as follows.

  Q:Should I define the pre-processor variable OSFCDS_REFERRALS?  

  If the answer is NO, then questions
  Q:  Still, can the switch function be supported in GDS?


  If the answer is YES, then questions
  Q: It is necessary to compile d21_cds_ref.c, but when I compiled 
     d21_cds_ref.c, the compiler reported the error of "include file
     gda_x500.h not found."

     Really, there is not gda_x500.h anywhere, and we can't continue compiling
     What should we do?

Note: There is gda_x500.h when GDS V1.0.3, but it is not used in GDS V1.1.

Thank you.

[5/17/96 public]

This CR has escaped notice for some time because of some missing
field values. I changed the "subcomponent" field to port_gd, but
am cancelling the bug, since the Porting Guide is not supported
anymore. Although if it's a matter of "XDS switching between GDS
and CDS not [being] provided" (see first comment above) perhaps
some other books need to be updated.

The code and tests are correct.

I'll fix the rfc and will file a doc bug.  
Too late to fix it.

[12/18/95 public]

As far as I can see, the link manpage has the -to form of the
option now, not -linkto. I'm not sure when this was fixed (it
was apparently not done during the recent pass over the dcecp
pages, since it doesn't show up in my set of old files), but
in any case it's done now. Just to make sure I'm not confused--
the request is to change "-linkto" to "-to", correct? Unless
Howard thinks I've misunderstood something, I'll cancel this
bug (tomorrow, weather permitting).

[1/9/96 public]

No one has objected, so I am cancelling this bug for the reasons
described in the paragraph above.

Please make sure that all of
the RPC status codes are documented both in the reference materials and
in the online-help.

The current problem I hit is that most of the many rpc_s_auth* errors are
not documented in the DCE_RPC status_codes section of the help.

Here is a list of status codes from rpcsts.h that are not documented
in the online help:

From a search of rpc.msg the status codes which are preceeded by an #! are
not intended to be documented (I would much prefer that they all be
documented even if the message is that "this error should never occur,
please file a QAR" as we have a terrible track record of determining
whether or not they actually can occur or not.

Here is another CR that apparently went missing because of
unusual field values. I'm not sure if this is really a DCE
bug as such (since I'm not sure what is meant by "online
help" here), but I'm assigning it to Digital, since that
seems to be where the knowledge lies. Sorry Evelyn--if I'm
confused about this let me know.

I am also downgrading the severity to "B".

[9/26/96 public]

I am cancelling this bug since the return values listed as missing
have either been coded in SAMs files (and thus included in the Problem
Determination Guide) or removed from the code base (rpcsts.h has gone
away).

Extended login audit points were never added to 
the code and there are no plans to add them 
(according to kline_s and sommerfeld).  
Marked this bug as cancel.

[10/17/94 public]

This is a placeholder for the documentation for the new extended 
login audit points.  I have not yet seen this although it may
have already been submitted.  Just being thorough.

[10/21/94 public]

Fixed Fix in Baseline Field to 1.2.

[11/1/94 public]

Extended login audit points didn't make it into 1.1.  If they go into 1.2,
then they should be documented.

I'm opening this CR for Hal Lichtin...the dce_db* routines
need their own intro page. Assigning this CR to Peter Neilson
(OSF backing store writer).

[10/04/94 public]
I'm cancelling this because Julie Buckler already wrote the dce_db_intro
page in the course of her work on CR 12204.

OT is a reminder that it also has to be
removed from the docset.

[08/25/94 public]
Assigned to writer Willie Williams (security component
doc owner).

[08/25/94 public]
Reassigning to Ron Johnson at DEC.  Digital provided the documentation,
and I want to ensure that all relevant GSSAPI documentation is changed to
reflect this deletion (that may mean just the man page but...)

[hal 10/5/94 public] 
I checked the man3sec reference pages and the sec App Dev Guide chapters

Customer reported:

     "In order to gather DEBUG information from the RPC component, one must
     set the RPC_DEBUG environment variable from 1-25, with various levels
     between 0 and 255 for each flag.  However, some of these flags have
     undocumented minimum (and probably maximum) values.  One in particular
     that I ran into is flag number 18, rpc_e_dbg_pkt_quota_size.  If I set
     this flag to a value of less than 100, I could not get the TCP perf
     test to run.

     If we could be given a range of valid flag ranges, as well as whatever
     interdependencies there are between flags, it would be most appreciated.
"

[8/15/94 public]
A few points:

 - the RPC_DEBUG variable is for internal (and possibly external)
   debugging only.  Thus, if you need to know what its limits are
   and how to use a specific function, you look at the code.

 - The RPC_DEBUG facility for 1.1 has been converted to use serviceability
   thus, it ranges (1-9) and facilities (use dcecp log command) are
   now 'well known', and again, if you want specifics, you are
   certain to have access to the code base.

I don't believe that with the limited resources we have left, 
that spending much time documenting this (unsupported) debug 
interface is worthwhile.

[08/23/94 public]
Canceled this CR.  The Serviceability debugging facility is
now explained for each component in the Porting Guide, including
RPC.  Enabling RPC debugging output is also included in the explanation.

The routing file/template needs more/better examples. In particular,
it would be REALLY nice if it listed all the available component
abbreviations ...

[08/12/94 public]
Perhaps this is more appropriate for the porting&testing book, and not
the sample file.  Certainly knowing that "sec" "rpc" "dts" etc are
valid component names for debug messaging isn't very useful without
knowing that the sub-components mean.  But I could be wrong.  I think
you should feel free to add (as comments) more useful examples if
you want as a way of fixing this CR.

[8/15/94 public]
You're right - I meant to say sub-components as well - if it IS too
much to make a useful table/template w/in this file
(/opt/dcelocal/var/svc/routing), then yes, this
is info that should be in the porting and testing guide. I'm adding
the component names here and switching this to a doc bug - if the
end result is that we can plug a useful subset of what's in the
guide directly in the file, I'll be getting what I want ...

Filled in the "Fix By Baseline" field for housekeeping purposes.
This may change when Doug (Resp. Eng.) reviews the priority
and severity for this CR.

[10/26/94 public]
I may not be marking this correctly, but here's what has happened.
It was finally decided that  the component and sub-component abbreviations
ought not to appear in the manpage, so they were taken out. However,
such lists do appear in the Porting Guide, and they are being updated
for 1.1. I do not know if these lists appear anywhere else in the
documentation.

Just wanted to test that "1.1doc" is a valid value
for fix by baseline.

[7/21/94 public]

The directory:

src/security/client/admin/acl_edit/svr_example

is being moved to:

src/test/security/api/moretests

because, while it is part of the delegation functional
tests, it is obsolete as an example of an acl mgr (it does
not make use of the new 1.1 acl library).

I'm afraid I don't know which book(s) this affects.

Since the acl_server really doesn't have anything

This may be a obscure set of circumstances, but they were
produced adding the change_master command to the security 
replica_checklist test. 

A cell is configured with a security server and replica.  The master
registry is backed up by hand.

The replica server is made the new master via the sec_admin change_master
command.  New account, principals, and groups are added to the new master.
After verifying that the changes have been made on both registries, the 
change_master command is again invoked to change the master back to the
original master registry.  Again the changes are verified. 

The security server is then shutdown and the original master registry is 
restored.  The security server is restarted with the secd -restore_master
command.

Performing a dce_login on the security server at this point will cause a
core dump of secd.  A quick look at the core showed a procedure 
obsolete_master_task on the stack.

[7/13/94 public]

[7/13/94 public]
From the scenario described, this problem can be caused by race condition.
When a secd -restore_master command is issued, all replicas except
those marked with deleted will be re-initialized from the master.
However before a replica was set to be init-rep state, a dce_login
could have bound to it.  Then this replica found that the master had an older
update sequence number than it had.  So it issued an obsolete_mask call to
the master.
I tried this scenario once on my HPUX setup and did not get the same
result.  Can you have this happen all the time ?  If you wait a little
while ( bring secd up with -d -v option for execution information) until 
all init-rep is done, will you have the same problem ?

[7/14/94 public]

I got the following output when re-creating the scenario with 
secd -restore_master -d -v.  It would appear that dce_login is not involved.

[7/21/94 public]

This case described here is considered correct behavior.
The system depends on the master seqno increasing as masters
are changed.  Duplicate masters are sorted out by automatically
making the master with the highest master seqno win and by error
exiting when a master detects that its master seqno is less than
another master seqno in the system.  There is a new command line
flag, -master_seqno, can be used to set the master seqno manually
when a master has exited because its master seqno is lower than 
another one in the system.  This flag could be used in the case
you described.  But, in your case, it would be better to use other
methods for getting the master on-line, such as forcing the previous
master to be the master (sec_admin> become -master), re-creating
the replica that you're trying to restore from the forced master,
and then doing a change master to this recreated replica.  You
would lose less data that way.

[7/21/94 public]

My understanding is that there is no master in the cell at the time that 
the secd -restore_master is attempted.

The change master command is invoked twice.  If the original master is on 
node1 and the replica is on node2, the change master command is invoked 
once to change the master to node2, and again to change the master back to
node1.  The sec_admin lrep commands would indicate that there is only
one master in the cell at any given time.  (We will use the become_master 
command in the future.)

Prior to the secd -restore_master command, a sec_admin stop command is used to 
bring down the master on node1.   A restore of the original registry (without
the test accounts/principals/group) is performed, and then restore_master
is attempted.  Some data is lost, the intent is to verify that a different
registry has been restored.

[7/26/94 public]
A replica with a higher master seqno can imply there may be a new
master exist(ed) in the system.  Since you restore an older verion of
the rgy database, its master seqno is older than the replica so
it fits into this scenario.  Secd then exits and set its state to be
duplicate-master.  You can then re-start secd again using the 
-master_seqno option to overwrite the one stored in the system.

[7/28/94 public]

I will change the replica_checklist test to follow the scenario you
suggest.  I'm re-opening this under doc to assure that the behavior of
secd -master_seqno, change_master, etc. is documented.

[8/4/94 public]

In re-running the replica_checklist test, I've found that the 
secd -restore_master now works in the way I would have expected.  No core dump, the original registry is restored sans the test accounts/principals/group.  
(I'm running a build from the middle of last week.)

I have no interest in beating this dead horse, let's just make sure the current
behavior gets documented.

[7/11/94 public]
There is no documentation for the GDS sec tests.  This is necessary because
this test has different configuration requirements than every other admin
test -- i.e., it configures it's own GDS namespace rather than assuming on
exists, it requires DCE be activated, and that a principal 'gds_cl1' be
created.

[7/22/94 public]
No, SNI is on the hook for the documentation.

[8/24/94 public]

Downgraded to B1, but still needs to be done for 1.1.

[10/17/94 public]
Section 7.4 of the Porting and Testing Guide now includes documentation
for the GDS Security Enhancements Tests.

[10/25/94 public]
Actually, it doesn't.  However, some architectural changes made to
local_TET.admin for OT11279 obsoleted this.  Basically, the GDS and DCE
configuration for the test environment is built into the test itself so no
external cell or directory service configuration is need. 

This defect is obsolete.  Cancelled.

It would be very helpful for documentation to describe the output
of a klist.  Maybe annotate a sample klist output.  Right now you
have to guess a bit.  For instance, what does "Identity Info  Expires"
mean?  Probably not what it says.  A complete discussion would reinforce
the documentation on service tickets.


+

[6/15/94 public]
The output of the klist command was documented in the (now 
defunct) User's Guide.  I believe the klist explanation has been 
moved to the chapter called "Creating and Maintaining Accounts" in 
the security section of the current Administrator's Guide.

[6/29/94 public]

Pam is correct. klist output is shown in "Creating and Maintaining
Accounts" (admin_gd/security/security/4_accts.gpsml). I am cancelling
this CR.

In FVT ./dce/utils/acldb/ts/db/dce_db_misc.c[db_lock], the dce_db_store()
routine succeeds in inserting into a locked BS when I believe it should
return db_s_already_locked.

The same may or may not be true for other DB update operations should as 
dce_db_delete(), etc.

[9/6/94 public]
Reran FVT's.  Looks like same thing still happens.

[9/16/94 public]
It's supposed to behave this way.  One big reason: you may want to lock the
backing store to do multiple stores (or deletes).  I'll adjust the FVT.

Peter, would you check that the doc for dce_db_store* and delete* say
that if you want the thing locked, lock it yourself?  Then update this CR
(and I'll close it when the FVT is checked in).

[10/19/94 public]
I'm cancelling this CR because 12232 addresses the matter directly, and I
fixed the documentation as it requested.

Since changing a DCE passwd is something users will have to do
on a fairly frequent basis, the User's Guide should explain how
to do that.  It currently does not.  This bug should be opened
in OT as well.

[4/18/94 public]

Because the methods and tools used to change passwords varies
from DCE platform to DCE platform, it is my understanding that
this information is considered to be vendor-specific. See

The man page for sec_login_release_context() needs to mention that this
routine keeps a ref count and when it hits zero, the equivalent of
sec_login_purge_context() is done.

  From: burati@apollo.hp.com
  When you call rpc_binding_set_auth_info() with a login context, it bumps
  the refcnt If you call it 5 times for different binding handles, it will be
  at 6 (1 for the initial context setup).  If the client then does a
  release_context, it'll be at 5.  The runtime will call release when it's
  done with it for a particular binding handle and when the last of those is
  released, the context is no longer referenced by anybody, so it can be
  purged.

[4/5/94 public]

Assigned this CR to Pam Millett (HP security writer).

[4/5/94 public]
cancelled.

From: rps@apollo.hp.com
No, he says "it can be purged", not "release causes a purge".
_release_context() reference-counts the handle, but when it hits
zero the creds don't get removed from the system.

From: burati@apollo.hp.com
Actually, Rob is right.  I was thinking one thing and typing another, so my
reply probably implied that it was doing a real sec_login_purge_context().
What really happens is that when you release it, you decrement the refcount
(but don't even free any memory).  When the refcount hit's 0, all memory
for that 'in memory' context should be freed because nothing else in the
process can be using it anymore.  BUT, that doesn't mean another process
isn't using it, so it doesn't 'purge' the file based cache for that login
context.

While doing work on the DTS error messages, I cam accross the following
misleading exaple in the OSF DCE Administration Reference.

On page 3-31 the example shown is:

dtscp> update time 1993-12-30-11:24:00.000-0500I0.000

This indicates an inaccuracy setting of 0.  However, on page 15-18 of the
OSF DCE Administration Guide--Core Components it states:

   The minimum reliable inaccuracy that you can achieve with the update 
   command is approximately 1 second.  Human error and processing delays 
   combine to make lower settings unreliable.

There are format errors in the table which describes the gdssysadm
switches.

(It looks like there are vertical lines which should seperate the columns
in the table.  The lines, however, are printed serially beneath the table.

[3/15/94 public]

You looked at the "man" (i.e., nroff) version, right?  There are a lot of
problems in general with nroff versions of man pages that contain tables.
For example, most of these have to be run through a postprocessor called
col in order to make them look at all decent.  This is a problem of various
man commands, not of the doc source.

The table in question is a monster, but I don't think we're going to do
anything about it.  It looks OK when formatted for PostScript.  When you
run the nroff output through col it looks somewhat less bad, but the only
way to fix the appearance online would be to reformat the table completely.
It's just too wide to fit into 80 columns.  In fact, if you run the nroff
through col and display the output on a wide window, the table looks fine.
It should be reformatted, but it's not on anybody's agenda to do that.

[3/15/94 public]
Yep, that's what I was looking at, alright.  Nevermind ....

install-ref tool in DTE filters .nS macro definition (in sml) incorrectly
when it prepends it to the installed man pages. The original definition
of ".nS" macro in macros/sml file contains the following lines:

.el .ds yy \\$1:\ \ \"  use user-supplied note header..
.ft B

The filter in install-ref prepends the filtered sml file to each man page.
For filtering sml file it calls 'sed' several times as shown below:

# This is what we will insert after the .TH

if $sml_insert ; then
    echo '...\" ______________ start of SML macros ______________' > $smlinc
    (cd $sml_dir ; cat header.all sml rsml ) |
        sed -e '/^\.\.\.\\/d' -e 's/[   ]*\\\".*//' \
            -e '/\.d[es] [A-Za-z][A-Za-z]$/s/ //' \
            -e 's/^\.   /./' \
            -e 's/\.el /.el/' -e 's/\.if /.if/' -e 's/\.ie /.ie/' \
                >> $smlinc
    echo '...\"'  >> $smlinc
    echo '.rm zA' >> $smlinc
    echo '.rm zZ' >> $smlinc
    echo '...\" ______________ end of SML macros ______________' >> $smlinc

The second "-e" in line "sed -e '/^\.\.\.\\/d' -e 's/[   ]*\\\".*//' \"
filters out * \"  use user-supplied note header..* in the ".nS" definition
and this escapes the new line character due to preceding back slash.
So the string 'yy' gets defined to the remaining text on the line plus
next line, i.e., ".ft B" at the end. To fix this problem change the line
as shown:

 Original: sed -e '/^\.\.\.\\/d' -e 's/[   ]*\\\".*//' \
Suggested: sed -e '/^\.\.\.\\/d' -e 's/[   ]*\\\".*/ /' \
                                                    ^
                                                    | space here

This extra spce before new line will allow back slash be taken as 
escaping space and not the new line.

[3/4/94 public]

After trying the above change failed in other definitions that were not
expecting space if there was not space before '\"' pattern. So to correct
that problem, I added one more -e in the sed command above as show:

 Original: sed -e '/^\.\.\.\\/d' -e 's/[   ]*\\\".*//' \
Suggested: sed -e '/^\.\.\.\\/d' -e 's/[   ]+\\\".*/ /' -e 's/\\\".*//' \
                                            ^       ^  ^<-ADDED NEW-->^
                                  CHANGED-->|_______|  |______________|

This appears tobe holding so far. However, if this one too turns out
to be a problem also then the 'sml' macro file needs to be changed.
Possible fix could be in defintion of ".nS" :

Original:
.el .ds yy \\$1:\ \ \"  use user-supplied note header..
.ft B

Proposed:
.el \{\
.ds yy \\$1:\ \ \"  use user-supplied note header..
\}
.ft B

This works without requiring any changs in install-ref.

OSF needs to choose the correct fix and please let us know.

DCE documentation folks are not responsible for fixing bugs in the DTE, so
I am canceling this report.  I added doc-tools to the interest list CC.
The person currently responsible for doc tools at OSF is Fred Dalrymple
(fred@osf.org), who is on the doc-tools mailing list.  Fred will have to
decide what to do about this report.  My understanding is that he is no
longer fixing bugs in the old (pre-SGML) DTE.

In the 1.0.2 App. Dev. Ref page on sec_login_get_expiration, there
is an example code fragment where the status parameter from 
sec_login_refresh_identity is tested against a constant identifier
called "sec_login_s_refresh_ident_change".  I looked around and I don't
think DCE defines this particular error code, and I don't think
the intent here was pseudo code.

Another problem with the example is that it suggests that 
sec_login_refresh_identity would likely fail because the "identity has
changed".  I might be wrong (I'm new to DCE) but I think the more 
likely reason is that the "max renewable lifetime" has expired and the
login context is simply invalid.

[1/12/94 public]
Just fixed a couple of errors in the defect(ie: book where
example occurs, and short description).  By the way, I can't find any
mention of sec_login_s_ident_change in the dce 1.1 tree.

[1/18/94 public]

Assigned this CR to Pam Millett (HP security writer).

[6/17/94 public]
The reference to sec_login_s_refresh_ident_change was 
changed to sec_login_s_refresh_ident_bad by CR8173 in 
Release 1.0.3.

Note also that max renewable lifetime is not used in 
the DCE and thus cannot be a cause of failure.

I've changed the status of this CR to cancel.

The rpc.cds.3 and rpc.sec.2 system tests can now be run intercell.  As of
1.0.3, I believe that some of the documentation mentioned that these tests
could not run intercell.  These mentions should be removed, and information
should be added about how to set up intercell trust and how to modify the
configuration files for the tests in order to run the tests intercell.

DCE 1.0.3 IDL ignores the IDL ACF attributes in_line and
out_of_line and no longer generates "aux" files. As part
of its DCE 1.1 work, Digital is in the process of removing
documentation of the attributes from the chapters in
Part 3, Remote Procedure Calls (see CR 9601). Documentation
about this functionality also needs to be removed from the
OSF-owned portions of the App Dev Guide. The places I've
found are:

- Section 1.5.4, "StepA4/Client and Server: Write the .acf File"
file is /app_gd/overview/chap1.gpsml)

- Chapter 3, "A Sample DCE Application" and the timop program itself
file is /app_gd/overview/chap3.gpsml)

- Section 11.1.1 "Generating an Interface UUID" (bulleted
items for _caux.c and _saux.c need to be removed...this is
actually in the RPC part, but Digital has not currently
removed it. File is /app_gd/rpc/3_build_app.gpsml.)

If timop is to be replaced with another example at DCE 1.1,
much of this work can be changed to removing references
to timop's functionality.

Documentation about using the environment variable
IDL_GEN_AUX_FILES for pre-1.0.3 IDL makefile compatibility
probably needs to be added (but this book might not be the
right place for it).

In the Users's guide section 4.5.2 "Using the assign Subcommand" and in
section 4.5.3 "Using the substitute subcommand" there are references to
section 4.7.1 which are incorrect.  I don't know where they are supposed to
refer to, but section 4.7.1 is "The mask_obj Mask" and that clearly isn't
correct.

[12/23/93 public]

The "substitute" command has a dcecp equivalent (acl replace).
So, following the current DCE 1.1 plan, section 4.5.3 will
be eliminated, and the DCE Administration Guide will describe
how to use "acl replace".

The "assign" subcommand does not have a dcecp equivalent.
The current plan is to retain the information about control
program functions that do not have dcecp equivalents. In
addition, this information will be moving to the DCE
Administration Guide, since the plan for DCE 1.1 is
to eliminate the User's Guide and Reference.

Consequently, fixing the pointer to point to the
right example (which I *think* should point to
the "opus" example in Section 4.5.1) is not the
fix to make. The correct fix is to repeat the
"opus" example in section 4.5.2 so that the
reference to it doesn't get lost in all the file moves.

Because I'm the book owner for the User's Guide and
Reference and will be the one moving these files
around, I will assign this bug to myself and confer
with Pam Millett at HP to find out which file is
intended to be described in Section 4.5.2.

Affected file is /users_gdref/security/5_auth.gpsml

[12/23/93 public]
Actually the assign command in acl_edit can be done with something like:

  acl replace /.:/foo [cat <filename>]

RFC 42.1 will point this out.

[12/23/93 public]

Aha. In that case, we can eliminate Section 4.5.2, "Using
the assign subcommand" and I can cancel this CR, since
both Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 will be "going away".

Chapter 1. DCE RPC Administrative Facilities, in the DCE Admin Guide needs
to be updated. Here is a list of things where to start:

1. There are several references to the file rpcdllb.dat which is not
   longer used. 

2. There is not reference to the file <dcelocal>/var/rpc/rpcd.log

3. References to /etc/dce.rc should be changed to /etc/rc.dce. Also, it
   is /etc/dce.clean that clears the endpoint database and it is not
   done as part of a system reboot necessarily.

4. Throughout this chapter the use of RPCD and RPCCP are always 
   capitalized and sometimes these words are bolded. To be in harmony  
   with the rest of the admin guide, all references to DCE programs
   should be in lower case (as they are) and bolded.

The following testcases require a different GDS configuration than the one
described in the porting guide:

add_entry1tv
compare1tv
list1tv
mod_entry1tv
read1tv
remove1tv

Therefore, these testcases are not run be default.  There should be an
additional description of how to configure GDS for these tests and
instructions on how to run them.

Done; should be updated by Doug Weir.

[10/25/94 public]
Actually, the conversion of the switch tests to run under TET obsoletes
this OT.  Cancelled.

The code in file/ufsops is one area which generally needs porting
when moving DFS to a new platform. The files in this directory
contain much OS specific code with little documentation.
It would be nice if there were a detailed description regarding
the routines in this directory, what they do, and how they
expect to interface with the native OS on which they run.
This would assist greatly those who are trying to port this
fearsome stuff.  (Currently the porting guide has one short
paragraph about this, and this isn't suffucient for anyone
who has to port this).

The getcellname command is not documented.  I don't know where it should be
documented.  There needs to be a man page at least.  It's source lives in
src/config/utils/getcellname.c.  It might only be a tool for dce_config to
use, but I think it gets installed, and if so we need to document it.
All it is, is a wrapper around dce_cf_get_cell_name().

[10/14/93 public]

For 10 points, which book is the one where no one ever expects to find
reference documentation?  Why, the User's Guide and Reference, of course.
Take a look at the last page.  And count this as another point in favor of
my proposal to get rid of (or at least drastically modify) that book.

I'm canceling this CR, but feel free to reopen it if you think the
getcellname documentation is inadequate.

The documentation needs to be updated to include instructions on the
use of the \ as an escape character in rgy_edit.

This is necessary because of the fix for OT 5359.

The DCE Administration Guide, section 18.3 should be updated to include
the following information:

The \ is used as an escape character in rgy_edit commands.  It must be
used when a rgy_edit special character is to be included in a string.

Ex. To add the string "mob" as a principal name, you would do the
    following:

		rgy_edit=> do p
		rgy_edit=> add \"mob\"

			or

		let rgy_edit prompt you for the string:

		rgy_edit=> do p
		rgy_edit=> add
		Add Principal=> Enter name: \"mob\"

If \ is to be part of the string, it must also be escaped - \\ .

This information should also appear in the Administration Reference Manual
on the rgy_edit man page.

[10/18/93 public]
Fixed and verified.  Verified by Mary Bennett.

[10/22/93 public]
I think we should remove (from 1.0.3 documentation) the reference of \ 
escaping from DCE Administration Guide, section 18.3 as well as
Administration Reference Manual since CR 5359 fixes are being removed
for 1.0.3.

[10/22/93 public]
The changes have been backed out.  I was sure I added a note saying so and why when 
I changed the priority, status, and fix by fields.  But, that note 
doesn't seem to be here now.

[8/29/94]
I've changed the status of this CR to cancel.  No changes are 
being made to rgy_edit for 1.1.

There is no way from within rpccp to enter a string (such as the name of an
entry) with a space in it.

  rpccp>  show entry foo bar

does not work.  Placing foo bar in double or single quotes does not work,
nor does putting a \ before the space.  There should be a way to do this.

There is at least one work around.  Enter the command from the shell prompt
as follows:
 
  $ rpccp show entry "foo bar"

I also suspect that you could make use of rpccp's environment variable
processing to handle this as follows:

  $ export NAME="foo bar"
  $ rpccp
  $ show entry NAME

but I have not actually tried this.

There should probably be a mention in the documentation of this problem if
it is punted because dcecp will handle thi.

[05/04/94 public]
This is being punted since dcecp will replace rpccp.

rpccp man pages and point admin to dcecp.

I went into the source to fix the error but found
it fixed already. (I figure Pam Millett fixed it during
her last round of bug fixes.) I examined the output of
the latest weekly doc build and the fix is there, too.
I am cancelling this bug, rather than closing it, since it's
my understanding that an "open to close" status
would mean that change markers would need to be
added to the source to highlight the corrected text
and the related CR, and it seems like overkill given 
the number of change markers in there already.

The man page for rpc_ns_profile_elt_inq_begin(3rc) does not describe the
error cases well at all.  The Output section of the PARAMETERS section is
useless.  The descriptions are nothing more than the names of the error
cases.  The DESCRIPTION section doesn't describe anything of what needs to
be done on error.  For example, do I need to call
rpc_ns_profile_elt_inq_done(3rpc) if an error occurred with the begin call?

One the rpc_s_incomplete_name error, which name is incomplete?  The
profile_name, the member_name?

What error do I get if the profile name doesn't exist?  I assume the
rpc_s_incomplete_name error.  Here's the harder question, what happens if
the profile exists, but no members match the inquiry (e.g., I gave a query
to match a specific interface_id and there are none in the profile), does
the begin call return an error?  Do I get an error on the first call to
rpc_ns_profile_elt_inq_next?  What error?

[9/24/93 public]

This CR is essentially the same as CR8574, which
(rightly) faults the error message documentation
in other rpc_ns* man pages. However, since it
makes recommendations for adding explanatory
information that's specific to rpc_ns_profile_elt_inq_begin,
I am leaving it as its own CR so as not to lose
the specific questions that it addresses.

The existing man page rpc_status_codes(7rpc) gives
somewhat better explanations of the output error
messages for rpc_ns_profile_elt_inq_begin. All
DCE error message documentation must be revisited
at DCE 1.1 due to the DCE 1.1 serviceability
project. Therefore, I am changing the "fix by" date
to "1.1" and assigning this bug to Steve
Lewontin, who presently owns the rpc ref pages.

Section 5.4 of the Porting & Testing Guide describes all of the GDS tests
except for the ROS tests.

Assigned bug to Doug Weir (OSF Porting Guide book owner)
and added Rich Nollman (SNI GDS writer) to interest list.

[09/22/93 public]
Dave Treff explained that there is no ROS test documentation
because the tests were never ported to either the AIX or the
pmax platforms. However, one of the 1.0.3 deliverables is a
"brand-new ROS implementation, with tests", and he says there
should be documentation with this. He expects it to arrive
"in a month or so" (this was on 7 September, so that means in
early October).

[11/7/93 public]
Fixed. This information was part of the updates from SNI which
arrived recently, and this has all been incorporated into Chapter 5.

[11/7/93 public]
Unfortunately this isn't quite done yet.  The documentation we received for
1.0.3 isn't really an adequate description of the matter.  The key thing
that is missing is a description of the GDS configuration required (if any)
to run the tests.

Since we're getting Yet Another New ROS in DCE1.1 we can defer this until
then.

[05/25/94 public]
There is no seperate RTROS test for the new RTROS. Old ROS is defuncted.
RTROS is tested implicitly by gds.
That's the SNI way to fix bugs.

I am canceling this defect for the following reasons:
 
1. The cm exportdfs command is not a supported DFS command; it was removed
   prior to 1.0.1.  It is not a part of the supported DFS interface, so it
   doesn't have a manpage.  If the command is visible to the user, a code
   defect needs to be opened to remove it from the interface.
 
2. The cm statservers command has a manpage in the DCE User's Guide and
   Reference.  The cm manpage in the DFS Admin Ref lists the cm statservers
   command as a level 1dfs command, directing the reader to the User's Guide
   and Ref for information about the command.  (The same is true of the other
   commands such as cm whereis.)
 
Thanks for reporting the possible problems.  It's good to know that someone
somewhere is reading this stuff.

	There is no one section which is totally devoted to acl manager
writing. The existing pieces are not that informative. The following is my
write-up on how to set up the acl server to work with the server it associates
and the acl_edit tool.



		Writing ACL Manager To Work With A Server

			   Weidong Wang
			 DCE Systems Engineering
			Open Software  Foundation

1. Introduction

	Access control lists (ACLs) are the basis for all DCE authorization 
decisions. ACLs provide for fine grained access control decisions.
Every application can have its own ACL database, which means every
application should have its own ACL manager to manage the ACL database.
DCE provides ones for the registry and CDS directory.

	DCE defines a set of ACL APIs (sec_acl_*, sec_acl_mgr_*, and rdacl_*). 
If the user application ACL manager adheres to these APIs, he/she can
use DCE acl_edit tool to maintain his/her ACL database.

	To be totally flexible, DCE pretty much leaves everything about
managing ACLs to the ACL manager programmer, from defining the ACL
permission set, configuring the ACL storage, to writing the access
check, lookup, update, etc routines. It is not a trivial task to
write an ACL manager and make it to work with a server, especially when there
is not enough good documentation around. The current existing document is not
that helpful in this area. Some are confusing, even contradictory to each 
other.

	This paper concentrates on the implementation issue of how to
make the ACL manager work with the server. It does not address the ACL
database issues (i.e. how to configure it, what permission bits to use,
whether to use a file to save the database, etc). We will be using the
sample ACL manager provided in OSF's DCE release (under
src/security/client/admin/acl_edit/svr_example). 

	It is assumed that the reader has the experience of writing a
basic DCE client/server application.


2. ACL APIs

	As mentioned before, there are 3 sets of ACL APIs. They are
sec_acl_ ones, sec_acl_mgr_ ones, and rdacl_ ones. Figure 1 (from Figure 2-12 
of OSF DCE Application Development Guide) shows how these APIs interact with 
each other.

	Usually sec_acl_mgr_ calls are the ones that the ACL manager
programmer has to write. These APIs define what one needs to write. One
may choose to use his own function names, as long as the necessary
functionalities are implemented. Rdacl_ calls, although simple, are
important. They provide a layer between the predefined remote procedure
calls and one's actual ACL functions. They basically just call the 
underlying sec_acl_mgr_ functions. If one wants acl_edit to work, he has
to use the predefined rdacl_ API names.

	Sec_acl_ calls are predefined and implemented. They can be
called by the client application to connect to an ACL server and perform
ACL inquiry. One of such a client is acl_edit, which is built on top of
sec_acl_ calls. 

	When the client calls a sec_acl_ call, it is actually making a RPC 
call.  The call will be routed to the ACL server, which eventually dispatches
to the corresponding rdacl_ call, which further calls user's ACL manager
function.


3. ACL Manager As A Stand Alone Server

	The sample code under src/security/client/admin/acl_edit/svr_sample 
gives a simple implementation of a stand alone ACL server. It uses
memory to store the ACLs (so once the server exits or is terminated, the
database is gone. But again, how to manage the database itself is not of
our concern here).

	You should be able to get the source and make it to generate the
server code. You can run this program (be sure to use -e option so that
it exports the binding information into the cell directory name space) 
and use acl_edit tool to manage the in-memory ACL database.

	One question people have is whether the ACL manager should
export the binding to the name space. Section 2.4.5 of the OSF DCE Application 
Development Guides says that "The sec_acl_bind() routine specifies the 
NULL interface when it performs its import. This allows applications
that offer the ACL interface to not export it vis
rpc_ns_binding_export(), which would greatly increase the size of the
name space". This means that if you are writing a server with an ACL
manager, then you don't need to export the ACL manager's binding
information, since the server itself will definitely export the binding 
information to the name space, and since the ACL runs in the same place 
where the server runs, there is no need to export again (This will
become clearer when we talk about how the sec_acl_bind() works below). 
But if the ACL manager is to run as a stand alone process, you
definitely need to do the export. Otherwise acl_edit will not work.

	In other words, when an ACL manager is coexisted with a server, 
any of the interfaces exported by a server can be exploited by 
sec_acl_bind() to locate the ACL manager making it unnecessary for the
server to export the ACL manager interface.


4. How Sec_acl_bind() Works

	In order to understand how acl_edit works, it is important to
understand how sec_acl_bind() works, since it is the core of acl_edit.

	When given a name, sec_acl_bind() first checks if this is a DFS 
name. If so, special treatment is given (we don't discuss it here). If 
not, then sec_acl_bind() checks if the call has the bind_to_entry 
feature ("-e" option used with acl_edit, which means you want to acl_edit 
the name space entry). If so, sec_acl_bind() drops the last component of
the name (so that it will bind to the directory that contains the name 
entry). Then it tries to resolve the name for as far as it can go
(remember that some names go through junctions, and the junctions are 
the last names in the name space. The junction will be the place where 
acl_edit will bind to. If there is no junction, then the name itself
will be the binding place).

	Now sec_acl_bind() starts to import information from the name 
space. First it arbitrarily gets a uuid from the name entry. Then it
uses this object uuid to get a binding from the name entry. Remember
that we have discussed above that there is no need for the ACL manager 
to export its binding information to the name space. As such,  the
object uuid and the binding imported at this stage is most likely
someone else's (the server's) uuid and binding. But a partial binding and
a server object uuid is all it needs to find the right server runtime.
After sec_acl_bind() finds a binding, it calls rpc_mgmt_inq_server_princ_name()
to find the server's principal name in order to set up the authentication 
information for the binding. This rpc management call, with a partial binding
from the name space, will end up with a fully bound binding based on the 
object uuid. As has been said many times, this uuid is the server's object 
uuid. This means sec_acl_bind() will return a fully bound binding to the 
server. But since the ACL manager and the server share the same server
runtime, acl_edit can further use the ACL interface uuid to distinguish itself
from the server call.


5. Writing An ACL Manager With A Single Manager Server

	This is the simplest case: one manager server with an ACL
manager.

	Because there is only one manager present, there is no need to set
the type for the manager object. By default, the manager object binds to
the NIL type uuid.

	The ACL manager can use the server's UUID, or it can have its
own object uuid. It doesn't matter which uuid you choose since either 
one of the object uuids will get the call to the right server runtime. 
Again, there is no need for the type set here. 

	Note: If the type has to be used, see the next section.

	Both the server and the ACL manager register their interfaces
with a NIL type uuid.

	The ACL manager does not need to export its uuid and the
bindings to the name space.

	When acl_edit is invoked, sec_acl_bind() will pick up the
server's uuid and one of its binding from the name space. The uuid and
the binding will get it to the server runtime. Following the control
flow of choosing a manager from Figure 2 (from Figure 14-16 of the OSF DCE 
Application Development Guide, it eventually goes to the flow with NIL type 
uuid.  Now it uses the interface uuid to pick the right final manager, your
ACL manager.

	As an example, suppose the server supports interfaces IS and ACL
interface IA. Furthermore, IS has one manager M1; and IA has one manager
MA. The following steps show how to set them up:

1). set up on the server part

	/* create server objects. OS is predefined in some header file */
	uuid_from_string(OS, &objs, &status);

	/* register the interface */
	rpc_server_register_if(IS, &nil_uuid, &managers_epv, &status);

	....

2). set up on the ACL manager part

	/* create the ACL object. QA is predefined in some header file */
	uuid_from_string(OA, &obja, &status);

	/* register the ACL interface */
	rpc_server_register_if(IA, &nil_uuid, &managera_epv, &status);

	...



6. Writing An ACL Manager For A Multiple-Manager Server

	If the server has more than one manager routines, then each
manager will have its own object uuid. In order to let the runtime pick
the right manager, you need to create a type uuid for each manager and
associate the object uuid of the manager with its type uuid through the
call rpc_set_object_type().

	The current document is not clear in this aspect. The author has 
spent quite some time researching this problem. There are several possible
ways, but it turns out that only one is the right choice. To help understand
the underlying details better, those possible ways will be explained below.
Keep in mind that acl_edit() has one of the server's object uuid and its 
binding that it imports from the name space. Please refer to Figure 2 to see
the control flow of how the runtime choose a manager.

	1) the ACL manager does not set type for its object uuid (use
	default NIL type uuid):

	This does not work since now the server's object uuid is typed,
	the call will always follow its type to find the a manager.
	Because there is only the server manager at that end, you get an
	error when invoking acl_edit of wrong manager type.

	2) the ACL manager set the object uuid to its own type:

	This is essentially the same as 1).

	3) re-register all server's object uuid with the ACL manager's
	type uuid by calling rpc_set_object_type():

	Well, this will make the acl_edit work, since now any one of the
	server's object uuid is typed to the ACL manager. But your
	server call will not work any more. This is because of the way
	rpc_set_object_type() works. When the second object is set to the
	same type uuid, the first object's relationship with the
	type is gone. This means the server call will be routed to the
	ACL manager too.

	4). register with the endpoint mapper multiple times, as suggested by
	the Section 2.4.5 of the OSF DCE Application Development Guide:

	This will not work either, since choosing a manager has nothing
	to do with the endpoint mapper. I will get to this issue later.

	The only way to make it to work is to register all the server's
type uuids with the ACL interface uuid and the ACL manager epv, as well as
registering the acl's own type. Now when acl_edit is invoked, one of the
server's object uuid will get it to the server runtime. Since that object 
uuid is also
typed, all the associated managers will be looked upon. The final
dispatch will be based on the interface uuid. Because now that type has
both the server manager and the ACL manager registered under it, an ACL 
interface uuid will get the ACL manager, and a server interface uuid
will get the server manager.

	As an example, suppose the server supports two user interfaces
I1 and I2, and an ACL interfact IA. Furthermore, I1 has two managers
with it M1 and M2; I2 has one manager M3; and IA has one manager MA. The
following steps show how to set them up:

1). set up on the server part

	/* create server objects. O1, O2, O3 defined in some .h file(s) */
	uuid_from_string(O1, &obj1, &status);
	uuid_from_string(O2, &obj2, &status);
	uuid_from_string(O3, &obj3, &status)

	/* create type uuids */
	uuid_create(&typ1, &status);
	uuid_create(&typ2, &status);
	uuid_create(&typ3, &status);

	/* set the types for the objects */
	rpc_set_object_type(&obj1, &typ1, &status);
	rpc_set_object_type(&obj2, &typ2, &status);
	rpc_set_object_type(&obj3, &typ3, &status);

	/* register the interfaces */
	rpc_server_register_if(I1, &typ1, &manager1_epv, &status);
	rpc_server_register_if(I1, &typ2, &manager2_epv, &status);
	rpc_server_register_if(I2, &typ3, &manager3_epv, &status);

	....

2). set up on the ACL manager part

	/* create the ACL object. OA defined in some .h file */
	uuid_from_string(OA, &obja, &status);

	/* create a type uuid */
	uuid_create(&typa, &status);

	/* set the type to the object */
	rpc_set_object_type(&obja, &typa, &status);

	/* register the ACL interface */
	rpc_server_register_if(IA, &typa, &managera_epv, &status);

	/* also need to register all server's types with ACL interface */
	rpc_server_register_if(IA, &typ1, &managera_epv, &status);
	rpc_server_register_if(IA, &typ2, &managera_epv, &status);
	rpc_server_register_if(IA, &typ3, &managera_epv, &status);

	...



7. About the current DOC on writing ACL manager

	The current DCE document does not have much to say about exactly
how to write a ACL manager and set it up to work with different types of
servers. The general description is often either misleading or cause
confusion. 

	For example, one of the bullet of section 2.4.5 of the
Application Development Guide says "... Finally, all object UUIDs for
objects with ACLs must be registered with the ACL interface UUID at the
endpoint mapper by using rpc_ep_register()."  As mentioned above, registering
all server's object UUID with ACL interface to the endpoint mapper does not 
solve the typed manager problem.

	This paragraph probably comes from the fact that when a client tries 
to ask the remote rpc daemon to find the end point for it, rpcd will use the
{object uuid, interface uuid} pair to search the local End Point Mapper (epm).
Intuitively, to make it possible for acl_edit to find the end point of the ACL
server, one would need to register all object uuids with the ACL interface in
the epm.

	Wrong. My research shows that it actually is not necessary to register
the ACL interface in the epm when the ACL server is associated with a server
that has already registered its object uuid and interface in the epm (this is
not true if you have a stand alone ACL server, or if you export the ACL server
to a different name entry than the server's. In these cases, you need to 
export the binding information, as well as register in the epm). See OT 8290.

	In the above section where how sec_acl_bind() works is discussed, it is
pointed out that after sec_acl_bind() gets a binding from the name space, it
makes a call to rpc_mgmt_inq_server_princ_name() which will use the object
uuid passed in to find an end point from the remote rpcd epm. Since the uuid
is one of the server's uuid, and we assume that the server has registered its
uuids and interface in the epm, rpc management call can find the end point 
from one of the server registration and resolve the partial binding (for more
information, please also refer to the man page of rpc_ep_resolve_binding from
the OSF DCE Application Development Reference).  The face that both the server
and the ACL manager are running in the same server runtime makes it possible to
eventually get to the ACL server with the ACL interface uuid.

This is to do with OT 8288, on how rpcd finds the endpoint for a partial
binding. This results in the following.

Does acl server need to register to the EPM?

The doc (section 2.4.5 and 2.5.1.2 of Application Dev Guide) certains says so. 
It even tells you to register all object UUIDs for object with ACL interface.
Obviously, this comes from the conclusion that in order to resolve the end
point, rpcd would search for the pair of object UUID and interface UUID.

Now we know this is not the case. Unless the application (acl_edit in this
case) calls rpc_ep_resolve_binding() explicitly, making a call with partial
binding will result in a mgmt call being made, which will resolve the end point
using object UUID ONLY.

So if an ACL manager is writen to run with a server from the same name space
entry, we know the server itself is definitely going to export its object
UUID(s) and interface UUID and binding to the name space, and is going to
register that/those obejct UUID(s) with the interface UUID to the EPM.

When acl_edit calls sec_acl_bind(), sec_acl_bind() imports A server object UUID
(again, the acl server does not have to export to the name sapce. See section
2.4.5 of app dev guide if you are not sure of this), then it uses NULL
interface to import A binding (partial). Th next thing it does is to set
authentication stuff for the binding. In order to do so, it calls
rpc_mgmt_inq_server_princ_name() to get the server principal name with the
partial binding. What do we know already? The mgmt call will resolve the
partial binding with the object uuid in the partial binding. The call not only
returns the server's principal name, it returns the fully bound handle too. All
the subsequet rpc calls to acl interface uses this fully bound handle.

What does it mean here? It means the ACL manager does not need to register
anything to the EPM as long as the server has done so already.

Why does it work? Becasue the acl manager and the server runs in the same
server runtime process. Once the calls get to the server runtime, the ACL
interface UUID can be further used to get to the right manager, the ACL manager.

Of course, doing the extra registration is harmless, but this is not the point.

If you implement a stand alone acl server, or the acl server is exported to a
different name space entry, then you sure need to 1. export to the name space,
2. register in the epm.

It is true that the only way for the ACL editor to reach the right server
is to look for the correct object in the endpoint map.  After all, lots of
servers export the ACL interface.  However, this kind of overloading of the
ep map entries doesn't work in every case, as the OT points out.  Given
that the current documentation tells you to do something that always works,
I'd favor leaving this for now and revisiting this question when we do the
policy guide at 1.1.

According to the DCE App Dev Guide Section 14.4.1, the algorithm for obtaining 
an endpoint of a compatible server with a partial binding is as follows:

1. if the client requests a non-nil object UUID, the epm wil use the
{obj-uuid, if-uuid} pair to search the mapper. If success, return the endpoint.
Otherwise, go to 2.

2. If the client requests the nil object UUID (or if the requested non-nil
object UUID is not registered), the epm will use the pair {nil-obj-uuid,
if-uuid}. If success, return the endpoint. Otherwise, failure.

The above description is not right. When a RPC call is
passed with a partial binding, the above algorithm is NOT applied. The above
algorithm is used when an application explicitly calls
rpc_ep_resolve_binding().

The man page of rpc_ep_resolve_binding() gives a better and correct explanation
of what happens when a partial binding is used:

"Partially Bound Handles with a Non-nil Object UUID

If the application has a partially bound handle with a non-nil object UUID, the
application can decide not to call the rpc_ep_resolve_binding() routine before
calling a procedure in the management interface. In this case the remote
management call is sent to a server instance, registered on the remote host,
that offers that object UUID.

After completing the remote management call, the application has a fully bound
handle to the server instance. The server instance that the handle specifies
probably offers the non-management interface of interest to the calling
application. However, if you want to be certain of obtaining a fully bound
handle to a server intance that offers the interface needed for later remote
procedure calls, call the rpc_ep_resolve_binding() routine."

The above description matches with my programming experiment. This explains why,
if after the server comes up and I change the ep registration with a different 
interface uuid, the application still runs.

The above description further reveals that whenever a call to the mgmt routine
is made with a partial binding, upon the return, the binding is fully bound ---
to the server with the matching object uuid only.

I believe OT 8288 reflects some misunderstanding of the role of
interface IDs in the binding process.  To begin with, the binding
information referenced by a binding handle does not contain an
interface UUID.  A partial binding consists of the tuple
object-UUID/protocol-sequence/host-address. A full binding adds an
endpoint to this. The interface UUID sent with a call is supplied by
the stub from the interface handle for the call.

When I make a call with a partial binding, the ep mapper uses both the
the object UUID and the (stub supplied) if UUID to find a compatible
endpoint, as described in the documentation.  Subsequent calls made
with the same binding handle--which is now fully bound--will no longer
make use of the endpoint mapper.  Hence, I can change the endpoint
mapping information in any way I want without affecting the success of
such calls.  Note that I can also make a call on another interface
using the same binding handle, as in the case of the management call
followed by an application RPC using the same binding.  In such a
case, the same binding information will be used for both calls, but
the stub will supply different if UUIDs.  As long as the supplied
interface UUID is registered by the server for the endpoint (along
with a compatible object UUID) the call will succeed, just as you
found.

In case you have any doubts about this, look at the cncall.c code for
connection oriented calls.  If you make a call on a binding without an
endpoint, the code actually calls rpc_ep_resolve_binding(). This call
itself makes a call to the endpoint mapper's map() routine, which is
also used for connectionless style call forwarding.

Now, the question comes up, what happens in the case of a management
call without an endpoint?  Here you can supply either an object UUID
or make an ep_resolve_binding call().  It would seem that in the
former case, the ep mapper can find you a binding for a non-matching
interface (since the mgmt interface ID is not exported to the endpoint
mapper) with a matching object UUID.  How is this done?  From
examining the rpcd code (specifically rpcdepdb.c) you can see that the
rpcd special cases the management interface UUID.  If the call is made
on this UUID, then the ep search algorithm is different and can match
on the object UUID alone.  In other words the documented endpoint
search algorithm does not apply in this special case.

My conclusion is that the endpoint algorithm described in the App.
Dev. Guide is essentially right for application specified RPCs.

Removing a non-existing value from a set-valued attribute gives
no error. I would guess it should say something. 
The pertinent man  page is remove object(8cds) in the Admistration 
Reference Manual.

The current inplementation by designe does not complain in such situations.
It might be argued that this should be rethougt in a future release but
right now this isn;t a bug. I opened this because someone asked about it
and at the time I wasn;t sure. I don;t remember who asked but if its
brought up again I suppose we'll open an enhancement request and *consider*
it in a future release but for now its canceled.

The man pages for the following five api's need to be changed:

   from:	sec_login_handle_t	*login_context
	
   to:		sec_login_handle_t	login_context

	- sec_login_get_current_context
	- sec_login_inquire_net_info
	- sec_login_purge_context
	- sec_login_release_context
	- sec_login_refresh_identity

[6/23/93 public]
According to security developers, only sec_login_inquire_net_info 
and sec_login_refresh_identity do not take pointers.  The 
other calls listed above do.  The 1.0.2 app_ref documents this 
correctly.  I am canceling this CR.

This issue is not related to building the docs, but what troff tools need to be

ERROR: this piece did not format to completion, and the section and page
ERROR:     numbers in the following pieces will be wrong

I'm reassigning it to the doc group.

Other than the known documented error message:

ERROR: troff: 1004-106 Font CW is too big for position 0
ERROR:  line 185, file -
ERROR: }0

you get assorted errors if you have the incorrect troff, however which
troff you should have is not documented somewhere readily accessible.

Examples of errors are:

	ERROR: troff: 1004-105 Cannot find or open
		/usr/lib/font/devpsc/CI.out
and 
	col: 1003-703 Cannot find or open /usr/lib/nterm/tab.psc
ERROR: this piece did not format to completion, and the section and page
ERROR:     numbers in the following pieces will be wrong

Also note the errors in Paul Ellis' comments up above.

In addition, you also cannot do "make all" on a RIOS machine as the
TYPESETTER variable must be set to 'ps" for postscript files and then reset
to "lp" for ascii files.
Since "make all" works on the PMAX, it should work in a similar
manner on a RIOS and on other reference platforms as they become availible.

Cancelled, it worked fine after copying the troff command from tinker
onto the QA test machine orange.

The manpage for the "deprecated" function sec_key_mgmt_generate_key()
is missing from the current docset (I don't know if it ever existed).  
Even though sec_key_mgmt_generate_key() is deprecated, it is still 
publicly accessible in libdce.a and is referenced in a number of other
manpages (eg, see sec_key_mgmt_gen_rand_key() ).  The manpage for
sec_key_mgmt_generate_key() should be included in the Appl Dev Ref.

According to Mike Burati, this call should not be documented.  
No one should be using it., but it is still in libdce in case 
anyone is still using it.

In section 3.4.2 "Creating Aliases" the instructions for adding an alias
are: 

  To create an alias for a principal, invoke rgy_edit and then enter the
  add command in the follwoing form:

    add principal_name unix_ID -al

The instructions should mention to do a "domain principal" principal
command so that the command works.  Note that in the other examples in this
section, "domain" is abbreviated as "do".

[7/13/92 public]
I've canceled this defect.  In Section 3.4.2 of the 
1.0.2 version of the admin guide, it says:

 "invoke rgy_edit and use the domain subcommand to move to the 
  appropriate domain (principal or group)."

I can't remember, but I may have fixed this as part or 6220.

The descrition in the Admin guide of aliases is incorrect.  It says that
only principals can have aliases, but groups can as well.  Interestingly
enough the rgy_edit(8sec) ref page does say that groups can have aliases.
Section 3.1.3 "Aliases" should change, as well as some part of section 3.5
"Using rgy_edit to Add and Maintain Groups and Organizations".

Yes.  This is a sort-of-flag that says "at the present time, one
or more of the protocols cannot support more than one listener
socket at a time, so just allocate one socket for the protocol." 
I say sort-of-flag because in the future, if
the protocols were rev'ed to the point where they could handle 
more that one listener socket, then this value would become a 
parameter value, and code internal to the rpc runtime that currently
uses this as a flag would have to be modified to use this value
correctly as a parameter.

  Currently, as noted in the rpc_server_use*protseq*(3rpc) man pages,
any value passed in the max_call_requests arguement is reset to the
value of rpc_c_protseq_max_reqs_default internally to the rpc runtime.
The rpc runtime routines that allocate network resources (sockets, etc.)
are then called.  Currently, seeing that the max_calls parameter has the
value rpc_c_protseq_max_reqs_default, these routines set up only one 
socket for each protocol.  In the future, the latter routines would probably
not check for this equality.

You are mixing apples and oranges in a way that became common due to the 
way that the DCE 1.0.1 docs were written (a problem that we believe we have
dealt with in the DCE 1.0.2 docs).  The rpc_c_protseq_max_reqs_default value
has to do with the number of calls the server can ACCEPT.  The 
rpc_c_listen_max_calls_default value has to do with the number of client
requests the server can EXECUTE in parallel.  The 
rpc_c_listen_max_calls_default value (if used in the call to 
rpc_server_listen(3rpc) specifies the number of threads that the rpc runtime
creates to concurrently EXECUTE server manager code in response to RPC's 
from clients.  It also affects the number of slots in the call request buffer
that the rpc runtime allocates to queue incoming RPC's when all of the 
server execution threads are busy, since the call request buffer is sized
on an "X slots per execution thread" basis.

Subject: ODE: Building DCE tools using the setup pass.
Date: Tue, 05 May 92 09:25:32 -0400


I have added the ability to build the DCE tools from ODE with a setup
pass.  To build the tools one of the following methods need to be 
used:  (${name} needs to be expanded by the user)

	1) cp /project/dce/build/dce1.0.1/rc_files/setup \
             ${sandbox_base}/rc_files
           (the setup rc file calls ./local then sets DEFTOOLBASE)
	   build -sb_rc ${sandbox_base}/rc_files/setup setup_all

	2) add the following line (as is) to ${sandbox_base}/rc_files/local:
	   replace setenv DEFTOOLBASE ${tools_base}/bin/
	   
	   then:
	   build setup_all

	3) build DEFTOOLBASE=${tools_base}/bin/ setup_all

Individual tools can be built by cd'ing to their directory and building.

All tools built by the setup pass will be placed into ${DEFTOOLBASE}.

The following is the list of tools built by the setup pass:
	compile_et
	idl
	idl.cat
	mavcod
	mavros
	msg
	prs

Only one DEFTOOLBASE can be defined for all DCE tools and all
tools are defined with DEFTOOLBASE unless overridden either 
on the command line or in a local Makefile

Although this implies that you will have to build all the tools,
you can still build a single tools and then specify that is 
should be used in subsequent builds.

One scenario which could be used to build one tool (e.g. idl) is:

	1) cd ${sandbox_base}/src/rpc/idl/idl_compiler
	2) build -sb_rc ${sanbbox_base}/rc_files/setup setup_all
	3) cd ${sandbox_base}/src/rpc
	4) build IDL=${tools_base}/bin/idl
	
All the dce tools can be built in ~23 minutes getting everything
from a backing tree.
   
If you have any questions or comments let me know.
-John 


		replace setenv DEFTOOLBASE ${tools_base}/bin/
     All tools built by the setup pass will be placed into ${DEFTOOLBASE}.
     
Folks,

Note that this means that <your_sandbox>/tools/<machine>/bin must be local.
I know that some people had linked their tools directory to the backing
build tools directory, e.g.:

	tools -> link/tools/

This was necessary to get the common set of language tools from the backing
build.  This isn't necessary any longer since absolute paths for the
language tools are provided by the makefiles.

Subject: THR: Thread-safety in RPC clients 
Date: Mon, 21 Dec 92 17:51:14 -0500


"Thread-safe" is a somewhat catchall term.  The important
concepts are:

- Blocking I/O should block just the thread, not the entire
  process.

- Routines which operate on shared objects should have
  appropriate reentrancy and locking in place.  Example: malloc.

In your application, you have a logically single-threaded client
application.  DCE will not surreptitiously invoke multiple
instances of your application; therefore your *application*code*
does not have to be particularly reentrant.

But DCE will spawn multiple internal threads for its own
purposes.  So the *process* is multithreaded, and therefore your
application must be built with DCE threads wrappers.  These
wrappers manage both blocking I/O and reentrancy of libc
routines.

Blocking I/O problem example:

- You execute an *unwrapped* blocking I/O call such as a read()
  from the keyboard.

- The read sleeps indefinitely.  All threads in the process are
  incorrectly blocked.

- A timer thread inside RPC which normally manages the RPC
  protocol is blocked, and eventually the remote side times the
  connection out.  If context handles were in use the application
  would lose its context.

Reentrancy problem example:

- An application is compiled *without* threads wrappers.

- The application invokes malloc.

- DCE threads interrupts the malloc with a virtual timer.  The
  interrupt handler executes a *properly-wrapped* malloc.  That
  wrapped malloc examines a lock and incorrectly infers that
  nobody else is currently doing a malloc.

- Que lastima.

Important disclaimer:

The DCE threads wrappers support only a subset of libc.  Before
using any potentially blocking or nonreentrant library routines,
you should first check to ensure that there are wrappers
available.

Everything described above is somewhat the worst-case scenario.
DCE vendors may make this a much better implementation by: 1)
shipping reentrant libraries (like libc_r), 2) using native
kernel threads packages to avoid any blocking problems.

Hope this helps clear up a DCE frequently-asked-question.

[04/13/93 public]
There is another class of things to worry about:  those common C routines
that cannot be 'thread-safe' because of their API.  For example,
things like gethostbyname() which return pointer to private static data.

[04/13/93 public]

I may be wrong about this, but it does not seem like functions which
return pointers to "static data" "cannot" be made reentrant.  It is 
possible to make these functions thread-safe by implementing them
using per-thread context memory.

It is not required by the definition of these functions to return
"static data".  All that is required is that they return a pointer
to data which the function has obtained in some way.

[4/13/93 public]

All of this discussion is also very applicable to people porting DCE.

Since our customers will need to think about these issues when productizing
DCE, we may want to have a cross reference to this topic in the Porting
Guide.

[4/13/93 public]
In my discussions with various people it has become apparent that there
seems to be a lot of confusion about what thread-safe means and how to 
get there. This is true even of people who have read our documentation. I've
recently talked to Doug Weir about addressing the problem and we both agree
that a fairly in depth discussion of the concepts is called for in the
app dev guide. I don't know if he opened an ot to this affect. If not
this one will do, if he has this is a dup of it. I'll check with him. The
above FAQ is a good starting point but probably needs to be expanded.
I've already agreed to work with Doug on but if  he isn't the doc person
doing the work I'll work with whoever is.

One of the notes in the FAQ is by Joe Pato giving an explanation
of DCE ACLs.  It looks like it goes in the App Dev Guide.  I think
it belongs in the security section, even though some info is on
binding.


From: pato@apollo.com (Joe Pato)

Subject: SEC: Object UUIDs and ACLs
Date: Mon, 1 Jul 91 10:22:35 EDT

Dick asked that I re-iterate my comments from the 6/27 tele-conference about
the server binding model used in the DACL interface (and the attending need for
object UUIDs by servers that export this interface).  I'll avoid repeating the
description of the end-point mapper and the attendant forwarding problems.

The DCE ACL interface is a generic interface - unlike most (all?) of the other
interfaces in existing DCE components, the DACL interface is exported by
multiple DCE components.  The benefit of using a generic ACL interface is that
a single editor (the one supplied with the DCE - or a better one written by an
application developer) will work with all acl objects in the distributed
environment.   The price paid for this feature is that the DACL interface
UUID is not sufficient information for obtaining a binding to a server.  (This
problem also exists for internal RPC interfaces - which by definition are also
generic, e.g., rpc_mgmt, NULL authentication principal).

Servers that export the DACL interface must register an object UUID in the
namespace.  Such a server must use a real UUID (i.e., not use uuid nil) to
distinguish it from other unrelated servers on the same machine.


Below follows some more detailed information on how binding works via the DACL
interface.  It may be too detailed for many dce-tech readers.  Feel free to
ignore this section.


The network interface for DACLs (rdaclif.idl) is simply a set of operations on
dacls using an RPC handle.  The API to DACLs adds a (actually two) binding
operations to generate the appropriate handle.  The primary binding operation
takes a global pathname to the object whose acl is to be manipulated.

The general binding mechanism is as follows:

The pathname is resolved as far as possible through the global name system
and divided into the object's name and a residual component name.  An RPC
binding is obtained by importing the object's name.  This binding is obtained
without an object UUID (since the calling application does not know the UUID of
the target object - just the name) and by specifying the undefined interface
(We could have performed the import operation by specifying the ACL interface,
but this would have meant that all nodes in the CDS would have to have an entry
for this interface greatly increasing the size of simple name system nodes for
little advantage).

Upon obtaining an RPC binding handle, the name system entry is then re-read to
extract the object UUID registered with the node (if more than one object UUID
is registered at the name the first is used).  At this point the object UUID is
injected into the RPC binding handle and remote DACL operations may proceed.

There are three cases we should examine (all three cases use the same mechanism
outlined above - but it is sometimes easier to understand what is happening if
we break out the cases)

    1) The pathname names an internal node in name system.
    2) The pathname names an object outside the name system through a
        junction point.  (I.e., the name is overqualified and names a 
        database entry).
    3) The pathname names a leaf node in the name system.

In case 1 the node is a directory entry native to CDS.  The CDS server will
conjure up the appropriate response to the binding request providing the CDS
server's own binding information.  The object UUID provided in this case is the
directory's own UUID.

In case 2 the node is outside the CDS and is found via a major junction point
in the name system.  The binding information is obtained from the leaf node in
the CDS and the residual component name is that portion of the name that is
beyond the junction point.  The object UUID is the first object registered at
the major junction point.  The target server (named by the leaf node)
determines the actual DACL object to manipulate by examining the residual
component name (In general this case only works for a single major protocol
junction - if the residual component name passes through yet another major
junction point, the client side will remain ignorant of the proper target
server).

Case 3 is slightly more complex.  In this case we might be operating on two
different objects.  The user may wish to change the DACL associated with the
CDS entry for a server (all CDS entries have DACLs) or the user may be trying
to set an acl at the target server named by the entry (i.e., a printer manages
a single DACL controlling who may use the different types of paper.  This is
distinct from the DACL controlling who can manipulate the name space entry). 
Since this is a common case (it applies to all leaf nodes in the CDS) the
binding interface (and the acl editor UI) allows the client to inform the
runtime if the operation should be performed at the target server or at the
catalog point.


Case 3 is really an example of a polymorphic object (the name resolves to both
an node in the name system and a target server on which the operation is
meaningful).  Polymorphism can also exist at other levels in the name space -
since directories can support full server entry attributes.  This means that
case 1 and case 3 are really the same in practice (and that case 1 is simply a
convenient way of thinking about operating on name system nodes, but that it is
really a subset of case 3)

Polymorphism also exists outside the CDS.  The primary reason the security
services do not allow directories to be principals is due to this.  The DACL
interfaces recognize the potential for polymorphism and allow an DACL manager
to inform the client that a given entry contains multiple ACLs controlling
different aspects of the entry (e.g., the DACL controlling manipulation of
principal data and the DACL controlling the manipulation of the name space
because the node is a directory)  Polymorphism in the CDS is much more common
than outside and we have a convenient mechanism for dealing with the issue. 
Details are available for the curious.  For nodes outside the CDS this
mechanism is unavailable and the editor interactively prompts the user to
select the acl type on which to operate.


Earlier I alluded to a second binding operation.  This operation allows the
client to obtain an rpc string binding to the target server and the residual
component name via its own means.  (This operation was necessary before the
availability of the CDS for integration, but is useful even in the presence of
a working CDS).

I just got burned by a change in the start up scripts
for OSF/1 1.1.1.  I thought I'd spare you the pain by 
telling you that in order to install a new library on 
OSF/1 1.1.1 (libdce for instance), you must run /sbin/lib_admin
explicitly.  It does not get run automatically in the sysetm 
startup scripts as it did on OSF/1 1.0.4, so a reboot is
not sufficient. 

This probably affects the DFS folk more than anyone else
since we're often installing kernels at the same time as
libraries so it's tempting to let the reboot take care of
both.

After having been burnt so badly by inlib during the 1.1.1 port,
I finally got up the courage to try it as a
quicker-than-lib_admin way to install a new libdce.so.

Amazingly enough, it works and is much faster than lib_admin.  So
here's the model:

- - Rebuild whatever libdce modules you are interested in.

- - Rebuild libdce.so

- - rmlib your_sb/obj/pmax/libdce/libdce.so (a preventative, ignore
  any diagnostic)

- - inlib your_sb/obj/pmax/libdce/libdce.so

- - dce_config, etc.

NB: Unlike lib_admin, inlib only changes children of that
particular shell.

inlib/rmlib are built-in shell commands.  They exist in sh,
ksh, and csh.  Sadly, not tcsh.

From: smk
To: dce-team
Date: Mon, 1 Feb 93 17:05:08 -0500

Not running lib_admin after "installing" a new libdce.so is also
the cause for the seemingly bizarre debug behavior. GDB will use
the symbol table/offset information from the "new" libdce.so while the
application is making references to offsets in the "old" libdce.so (which
have been recorded in the preloaded data files by lib_admin - and only
by rerunning lib_admin will the preloaded data files be updated).


SUP will update your preloaded data files

BTW, /lbin/sup/lib_admin is a script that will invoke /sbin/lib_admin
twice - once for single user mode.

The syntax for invoking lib_admin is ... /sbin/lib_admin -v /etc/lib_admin.conf

According to the AIX Info Explorer, you get a dump to the
primary dump device when you press the reset button. You can
also get a dump to the primary device by pressing Control-Alt-Numpad1
or to the secondary device by pressing Control-Alt-Numpad2, after
turning the key to the Service position. There is also a
command, sysdumpstart, to do a dump and halt.

Usually /dev/hd7 is the primary device, but there is a command,
sysdumpdev, to change it or the secondary device. sysdumpdev -l
will tell you what they are currently. Try also sysdumpdev -L which
gives stats about the most recent dump.

The command

	crash /dev/hd7 /usr/lib/boot/unix

will let you examine the dump. If you need to find out about the
crash subcommands, let me know - I can print out the Info article.

Subject: RIOS: Debugging Hints

I'm doing my first RIOS DCE debugging and have learned some tidbits:

1) If you are bringing up dbx and get: reading symbolic information ...Killed
then you must increase system paging space with smit.  Get someone who
knows what they're doing.

2) After that, if you get: reading symbolic information ...Segmentation fault
then you must bring up dbx with the "-f" option.  This tells dbx to defer
reading some symbols until it needs them.

	dbx -f /usr/bin/sec_create_db

3) In dbx, you need to say:

	ignore vtalrm

This tells dbx to not trap the virtual timer alarms generated by CMA.

More late-breaking news as it occurs.

[2/19/93 public]

Running the rpc Validation test suite with the dce weekly build (2/5/93)
found the following problem:

Supplying a non-NULL server binding handle to the
rpc_mgmt_is_server_listening api routine when the server is not listening,
the CN run-time returns status code "rpc_s_connect_rejected" instead of
"rpc_s_comm_failure". However, the DG run-time returns the correct status
code: "rpc_s_comm_failure".

This api test passed with prior dce builds. Also, the  status code 
"rpc_s_connect_rejected" is not listed in the Application Development
Reference.

[2/23/93 public]

I believe that the code is working correctly.  DG just returns a
generic error (comm failure) for any of a large number of failure
cases.  CN is more specific and makes an attempt to map back the
specific socket error to an RPC status code.

This means that this is a doc defect.  I leave it to Art to decide
how much specificity to incorporate.  You should also update the
VTS.

[3/18/93 public]

This appears to conflict with the goal of making choice of RPC protocol
transparent.  If the server is not listening, then there should be a common
status value used by both RPC protocols to indicate this condition.  I
don't think this should be classified as a doc bug.

Here's the results of hacking cma to read an env var and just return
the error code from cma_connect, cma_sendmsg, cma_recvmsg.

I agree that this should be reconsidered as more than a doc bug - it
makes for a rather long list of catches if you don't use a [comm_status]
attribute.

 - Communication failures in ncacn_ip_tcp:

   When using connection-oriented rpc (ncacn_ip_tcp), note that several
   exceptions are possible where rpc_x_comm_failure was the only
possibility
   for connection-less rpc (ncadg_ip_udp).  The following lists the rpc
   exception and the socket error condition(s) under which it is raised.
   Obviously, some of the error conditions are unrealistic for the tcp
   function requested (e.g., EHOSTUNREACH for sendmsg).

     connect error (client attempts to make tcp connection to server)

       rpc exception                    socket errno

       rpc_x_cannot_connect             ENOBUFS, ESHUTDOWN, ENOTCONN

       rpc_x_connection_closed          All errno 69-81.

[07/02/93 public ]

Given the tenor of the last two comments, I've changed this to a code bug.

[08/24/93 public]

Note the above issue pertains to all cn rpcs, not just the mgmt calls, and
occurs on at least aix+rs6000 along with the listed platform.

Wei's point is important, also. What might be more useful than the 
current socket error to exception mapping (where rpc_x_connect_closed
appears in too many cases) is a partitioning of the errors (using runtime
state) into something like rpc_x_bind_unsuccessful and
rpc_x_connect_closed.  In the former class the application would know the 
server never received the call args and might retry the call to another
server.  For the second case, the application might be more interested
in trying to reconnect to the original server.  Not exactly transactional
rpc, but might be useful (my guess is the vast number of call failures
would fall into the first class, but that's pure speculation).

[8/25/93 public]

This one seems to be growing...

The original complaint was that the documentation did not list all of
the possible status codes returned by the rpc_mgmt_is_server_listening()
call.  I believe this is a doc bug.  Even if we did what Scott suggests,
it will never be the case that [comm_status] variables are restricted to
returning only "rpc_s_comm_failure."  Given this, the documentation should
provide a (single) listing of all the possible values that might be seen
when using a [comm_status] parameter. (Or does it already?  I know the AES
does.)  This list will also be useful to developers who want to use

[comm_status] parameters in their applications.  The description of API 
calls that use a [comm_status] parameter to do their work could then just 
refer to this list.  

The other part of this problem is the claim that there are currently too
many possible [comm_status] return values.  I agree with the intent of 
Scott's proposal, but I don't think making the runtime filter the error 
cases is the right way to achieve it; we'd be losing too much information
just for the sake of making things "cleaner."

As an example, I just finished working with a developer who was having 
trouble reaching a particular server; the client returned the status - 
ENETUNREACH.  It turned out that the server was on a multi-homed node, 
with no routing done between the two local nets.  The client happened 
to be pulling the "wrong" binding handle out of the namespace.  The point 
is, ENETUNREACH was a *much* more useful status to see than something 
like "rpc_x_bind_unsuccessful".

Obviously, a developer can hide some of this complexity by writing a
macro:

    #define CATCH_ALL_COMM_FAILURES \
            } \
            else if (exc_matches(...) || \
                     exc_matches(...) || \
                          ...
                     {
                          ...user's code


Or we could add such a macro to exc_handling.h (as an enhancement).

[08/29/93 public]
Okay. I agree the connect errors are useful info and shouldn't be 
buried.  

Let's move this back to a doc defect. I'll open code defects on 
those distinct features of the two protseqs that seem hazardous
to app development.

----
Some cn & dg (based on runtime greps) errors:

rpc_x_unknown_reject

rpc_s_unknown_if   (e.g. wrong if uuid)

----
Some cn specific (based on runtime greps) errors:

rpc_x_server_too_busy  (from common rpc_s_cthread_not_found, dg pretends it
                        never got the call).

rpc_x_rpc_prot_version_mismatch

rpc_x_tsyntaxes_unsupported


These are interesting?????

rpc_x_too_many_rem_connects  ETOOMANYREFS 
  (from errno.h)
  /* BSD 4.3 RENO */
  #define ETOOMANYREFS    115     /* Too many references: can't splice */

rpc_x_connect_no_resources   ENOSPC       
  (from errno.h)
  #define       ENOSPC  28      /* No space left on device              */

Moving this back to a doc bug.  Perhaps the writer and those people
involved in this discussion (page, markar) could get together and
decide what needs to be changed in the docs.

[9/23/93 public]

Reassigned this CR to myself.

[10/6/93 public]

I consulted with Steve Lowentin (RPC AES, RPC guide and ref page
writer) on this bug. Here are the results:

1. The issue: the individual man pages for the RPC routines that return
the rpc_comm_failure status code do not list all of the
possible protocol-specific communications-related status
codes that might also be returned, e.g., rpc_s_connect_rejected.

2. A possible solution would be to add a list of all the
possible protocol-specific communications-related status
codes that can be returned to the rpc status codes man page
(rpc_status_codes(7rpc). Then, for each affected API man page, 
remove the specific listing of "rpc_comm_failure" from the list of
returned status codes, and instead say that the routine
can return the protocol-specific communications-oriented
status codes described in rpc_status_codes(7rpc).

3. This change is too intensive to be completed in the 1.0.3
timeframe given its schedule and the resources available.

4. The documentation strategy for the RPC status codes
(and the rest of the DCE APIs) will need to be revisited at DCE 1.1
in light of the DCE 1.1 serviceability project and the
planned DCE Error Messages manual (see related CRs).
A better solution than the one proposed in (2) could
be found as a result of this work.

Therefore, I am changing the "fixby" date from 1.0.3 to 1.1
and I am reassigning this bug to Steve Lowentin (current
RPC writer). The writer(s) who implement the solution
to this bug will make sure they consult with the developers
who contributed to this CR (desai, markar, page) to ensure
that the solution is appropriate.

And, since new bugs were planned to be opened against
the code part of this CR, I made this CR more doc-specific
(changed the "subcomponent" and "description" fields
to refer to the Application Development Reference and
the rpc_mgmt_is_server_listening man page instead of
code-related info).

[10/15/93 public]
Changed status to defer for purposes of the 1.0.3 release.  Will be
reopened after 1.0.3 finishes.

[8/26/94 public]
This DOC BUG is being closed because the new Problem Determination Guide (PDG)
should handle explanations of all errors, regardless of which routine
returned the message.  All possible errors may not be listed for a routine,
but the PDG will (is supposed to) give you the help needed.

	The porting and testing guide Section 4.5.2 is too simple. It only
	gives a man page for cp_test.sh. A lot of why and when are not
	there. For example, why do we have "-noshow" and "-nodeldir"
	switches,  when to use them, etc.

	Also nothing is mentioend about cdstest.c

   The -adminlist option has recently been added to the butc code.  This
needs to be documented.  The SYNOPSIS section on the butc.8dfs manpage
should read:
	butc [-tcid <tc_number>] [-adminlist <filename>]
	     [-debuglevel <trace_level>] [-bakgroup <server_group>]
	     [-cell <cellname>] [-help]
   Note also that a reference to this admin.butc file
should be included in the bakserver.8dfs manpage.

Added field Transarc Status with value `open'

[2/23/93 public]
I am lowering the priority of this defect because, while the interface change
made its way into the 1.0.2 code, the functionality provided by the change
did not.  It means nothing for 1.0.2 to be included in or excluded from the
admin.butc administrative list.  Knowing the priority of this defect was lower
than that of the others that remained, I chose to postpone its resolution
beyond 1.0.2.  It sounded like the right choice.
Changed Priority from `1' to `2'

section 3.4.2.2.3 of the dce porting and testing guide describes the perf
client test program. The various tests which can be run using this program
are enumerated and the syntax of their invocation is descibed under
"test_params". The format and content of this section should be improved to
include decriptions of what functionality is excercised by each of the
tests (e.g test 15 excercises thread cancellation functionality), as well
as more complete command line descriptions detailing the semantic 
relationships between the various test parameters in the context of each
of the numbered tests. In addition, some information should be provided
to aid the user in interpretting the output produced by these tests.

I am making this enhancement request, after recieving a service call
regarding a particular client test, I resolved by inspecting the test code
to learn what functionality was being tested, under what conditions, and
fromthis information I eventually drew the conclusion that the parameters
passed to the test caused explainable behavior to be presented in a
misleading fashion. The problem was simply that the user, in the absence of
information explaining how to assign values to related test parameters,
chose values which caused the test to produce output which, in the absence
of instructions on how to interpret test output, was perceived
(incorrectly) to indicate that the test had failed.

        Please provide the functional description of the following interfaces
        for additional features (from threads point of view) introduced by UTS.
        It should include description of the behavior when these wrapped
        interfaces are called from multiple threads simultaneously:

        tsafe_bind()
        tsafe_chmod()
        tsafe_listen()
        tsafe_unlink()
        tsafe_ioctl()
        tsafe_setsockopt()

        Note: The name of the interfaces from the wrapper names can be 
              extracted by picking the word after the last '_' in the above

              names.

        Please also provide the reference document name for the original 
        interface description.

        Why were these wrappers not provided by CMA instead of Time services?
        Are there similar other interfaces wrapped for thread-safeness but 
        defined by modules other than CMA?

29 Sept 92
Please reassign to threads. The time service does not provide
any of the requested routines in our API.

I don't think it is necessary to add another question to dce_config.
Generally, you want a gdad running.

The gdad is usefull even in cells that are isolated because
they might not be isolated forever.  It also will provide
a better error message for user trying to go outside a cell.

The bug is changed to a doc request to add a 
note telling the system administrator to comment out the gdad 
in rc.dce if you are going to have a isolated cell and don't 
want gdad running.
