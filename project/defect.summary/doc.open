dced 1.2.1 has an important new feature, partial service mode, and
a new option, -r, that enables remote administration of host objects.
The man page for dced has no discussion of these features, and the
man pages for dcecp and cell make only passing reference.

When documentation is added for how to toggle dced between full
and partial service, it should be noted that the SIGUSR1 mechanism
is specific to the UNIX implementations and that other implementations
will toggle the state in a different way.

Seichi Tatsu, formerly of HP, put a very informative design document
for these features in dce-tech a while back, that can be used for
reference.

[The current GDS admin guide has some steps missing and some important
information missing in the section when it tells you how to configure
a GDS server. I was asked to put down the necessary steps to set up
a GDS server and a client here.]

First, make sure that you remove old GDS installation. I was having
problem reinstalling and configuring GDS on top of old incomplete GDS
installation/configuration and it took me a while to finally realize that.

To remove the old installtion, do:

1. stop all GDS processes (from gdssysadm, type "d").

2. Rm old GDS installation/configuration files:

	rm -r /opt/dcelocal/var/directory/gds
	rm -r /opt/dcelocal/var/adm/directory/gds
	rm /opt/dcelocal/etc/gdsconfig

Now use dce_config to re-install GDS. Select "4" to install GDS server.
It will also install the client for you. It should run without any prompt.
This stpes also pro-configure Directory 1 for you as a client-server system.
You can check /opt/dcelocal/etc/gdsconfig file.

Ceck to see if your termcap has "ya" defined, if so, which key is 
for it. GDS configuration screen defaults "ya" for FKTMENU key to activate
a menu.

If you don't have "ya" defined, you have to edit 
/opt/dcelocal/var/adm/directory/gds/adm/adm_term_cap file and replace "ya"
with a defined key for FKTMENU. For example, if "k2" is defined (which is
F2, which is often defined), you can use "k2".

Now you can start the configuration steps:

1. Enter "gdssysadm", type "b" to activate the system (directory 1).
Use "f" and "i" to check the status. You should see 5 things: DUA cache
process, C-stub process, S-stub process, DSA process, and IPC monotroing
process. You can also use gdsdirinfo to see the status.

2. Now configure to talk to directory 1. From gdssysadm, type "a". You can
also exit gdsssyadm (by typing "^d") and start "gdsditadm".

2.1 configure DUA

From "Mask 1", enter "1" as directory ID, use "Anonymous" as authn.
and "Options: Logon to the DUA Cache".

From "Mask 3", select "1" for Object Administration.

From "Mask 4", select "5" for Add Client Address 

From "Mask 7a", enter "Client" as T-Selector, and
"TCP/IP!internet=127.0.0.1+port=16010" as NSAP-address 1
You can pick any unused port.

From "Mask 4", select "1" for Add Object

From "Mask 5", select "7" for Common-Name

From "Mask 6", enter the following: (pick your own name. Doesn't matter)

2.2 logon to DSA.

From "Mask 1", enter 1 as directory ID. Use "Anonymous" as authn. Select
"Options: Logon to the specific DSA". (Since the configuration of Directory 1
allows 2 DSA processes, it does not know which one is the default. You have to
logon to the specific one)

    Which function ? 1

Now you can add objects. Try add "us" (/C=us), then "us/osf" (/C=us/O=osf).

That is it for configuring a GDS server/client system. 


3. Configure a new directory

If you want to use a different directory, you is what you do:

Use "gdssysadm". Deactive the system first. Type "c" for configuration. 

On "confpar" screen, select "Creation of configuration data".

Give a new directory id. Choose whether it is just a client system, or it
will be a Client-Server system. 

Select how many clients you want to have access to the directory at the
same time. Default is 16.

For server system, select how many server processes (dsa process) you want.

Then select Athentication mechanism. The default is Simple Unprotected.

Now activate the system.

For configuration, go back to Step 2.1. Just remember to enter the new
directory id.


4. Inter-cell configuration

If you want to add a GDS named cell's information into the GDS, here is
what you do. Suppose the cell name is /c=us/o=os/ou=osfsun

4.1. in the cell /c=us/o=os/ou=osfsun, do "cdscp show cell /.:/ as gds". 
you will get something like the following:

$ cdscp show cell /.:/ as gds
                        SHOW
                        CELL   /.../c=us/o=osf/ou=osfsun

4.2. Logon to Directory 1, add object /c=us. Then add object /c=us/o=osf.
Then add object /c=us/o=osf/ou=osfsun. For this object, you need to select
from Mask 6d "CDS-Cell" and "CDS-Replica". Then enter the necessary 
in the screens followed after hitting F2 key to activate menu.

        Now you are in Mask 21. It asks you to enter namespace UUID, the root
        dir UUID, and root dir name. As you may notice, there is no root dir
        UUID from the above display. Actually, it is the same as namespace
        UUID. It is a historical reason that it is left here. Don't worry.

(you should see a bunch of output here. Don't have a real output handy)

From our developers:
Customer reports problem using sec_key_mgmt_set_key function.  The
problem was reproduced here, arg 2 is documented as accepting a
keytab file name that must be prefixed with the string FILE:.
However the function returns 0x141290b3 - Cannot write to specified
key table.  If the FILE: prefix is removed, the function writes the
file.

This appears like correct (although contradictory to the
documentation) behavior to me, so I asked dce-tech about it.  In base
Kerberos, the "FILE:" prefix is for non-writeable keytabs; the
"WRFILE:" prefix is for writeable ones.  I have asked on dce-tech
whether this is a documentation error or whether "FILE:" is supposed
to have become equivalent to "WRFILE:" in the DCE.  The deafening
silence which ensued (it's been a week) makes me think nobody ever
thought about it until now, which probably means the base krb5
behavior is supposed to be preserved.

In that case, it's a doc defect.  Any function which modifies a keytab
file should be documented as taking "WRFILE:", not "FILE:".  These
functions include:

        sec_key_mgmt_change_key()
        sec_key_mgmt_delete_key()
        sec_key_mgmt_delete_key_type()
        sec_key_mgmt_garbage_collect()
        sec_key_mgmt_gen_rand_key()
        sec_key_mgmt_manage_key()
        sec_key_mgmt_set_key()

Functions which only read keytab files (those sec_key_mgmt_* functions
not listed above) are OK to take "FILE:" as documented.

A customer complained that CDS should send out updates immediately
but apparently it waits.  Our developer discovered that it does 
indeed hold updates for one minute before beginning to propagate
changes.  But he felt that this is appropriate behavior, but that the
documentation should reflect this behavior.

Currently, the admin guide says (in two places):

"If an update is made to the directory, the server that stores the
master replica immediately attempts to propagate the new information
to the entire replica set."

This should be modified to say that updates are batched for a short
period before being sent to the replicas.

It's extremely unclear in the documentation how such things should be
added, especially for attributes with query triggers.  The evidence that it
is a code bug rather than a doc bug, however, is as follows.  :)

[8/13/96 public]
App Dev Gd, 28.4.1.1, Query Triggers:

If you execute a sec_rgy_attr() update call with an attribute type that
is associated with a query trigger, not an update trigger, the input
attribute values is [sic] ignored and a "stub" attribute instance is
created on the named object simply to mark the existence of this
attribute on the object.  Modifications to the real attribute value must
occur at the attribute trigger.

At 1.2.1 you should get a better error --

dcecp> princ mod foo -add {accounts present}
Error: updates of query trigger attributes must have encoding type void

Perhaps this deserves mention in the Admin Gd or Command Ref.

The function sec_attr_util_inst_free_ptrs() is the usual method
for freeing memory allocated for Extended Registry Attributes
(e.g. by sec_rgy_attr_lookup_by_id()).

RPC servers should not use sec_attr_util_inst_free_ptrs(), however,
since the function always uses "free()" as its deallocator.

RPC servers should instead call sec_attr_util_free(), which takes
a "deallocate" function parameter, but otherwise has the same
semantics as sec_attr_util_inst_free_ptrs().

Both the DCE Application Development Guide and the DCE Application
Development Reference should describe both of these functions.

I don't recall seeing this mentioned anywhere.  A server can only have
one set of well-known endpoints in its IDL file.  If you need two IDL
files with w-k-e's, then create a "fake" interface that defines them
all and make the rpc_server_use_{all_}protseqs_if.

Also, the rpc_server_use_{all_}protseqs_if manpages say a server that
uses these API's doesn't call rpc_ep_register.  That's slightly
incorrect.  It should say "it often need not..."

The following description in the online problem determination guide
is wrong:

     Code: 0x16c9a0a7 rpc_s_no_more_elements
           Severity: Varies
           Component: rpc
           Text: No more profile elements
           Explanation: No more profile  elements  are  found  in  the
           profile  lookup.   This is usually not reported through the
           API.
           Action: Report the error to your vendor.

This is a documented return code for rpc_ns_profile_elt_inq_next
(see the man page).

[6/4/96 public]

I'm assigning this to HP since the fix has to be made in the RPC
sams file. This is in fact a code bug, not a doc bug, since the
sams file lies in the code tree and is owned by the developers.
I can fix the text in any given version of the PDG, but that won't
fix the real problem.

A support customer reported that the DCE tools/install scripts do not
prohibit the use of a '/' in the hostname, however, the core component
code assumes that /.:/host/HOSTNAME is a simple DNS name. 

The support customer was working with a vendor who said that the OSF 
documentation did not claim that the use of a '/' in the hostname should
not work.

1.) The inconsistency in naming conventions of /.:/hosts/HOSTNAME, between 
    DCE install scripts and tools versus the core component code should be 
    documented.  (Release Notes )

2.) For now we should make it a restriction that /.:/hosts/HOSTNAME must  
    be a simple DNS name. No slashes allowed in HOSTNAME. (A code enhancement
    OT, can be opened in the future if required) 
    (Appendix A in the DCE Admin Guide - Introduction)

I am not sure exactly where this documentation would be most appropriate.
These seemed like appropriate places.


The following are excerpts are from the ticket log for this problem report.
==========================================================================

- - - --------- support customer writes ----------------------------->

	We have a customer which claims that OSF says that it
	supports /.:/<catagory>/<hosts> for cell configuration.
	We do not allow a / in the hostname and in review of the
	code I do not belive that this architecture is supported 
	by osf code.

	[snip]  after a long discussion
	regarding architecture versus implementation  with Rich Salz
	and in this conversation he said that the use of the 
	osf code looking for the hosts/<system_hostname/ipaddress> 
	was a bug.


- - - ----------- rsalz@osf.org writes --------------------------------->

	The DCE install script(s) and tools we distribute assume 
	/.:/hosts/HOSTNAME
	where HOSTNAME is simple DNS name.

	That's a bug in OSF code (dce_config, maybe elsewhere).  
	The host CDS name and host principal name can appear anywhere.


- - - ----------------- axg@osf.org writes ----------------------------->

	Before I open an OT on this issue, can you find out what lead 
	your customer to believe that non-simple host names were supported. 
	If the OSF documentation is incorrect I would also like to open a 
	doc defect. 


- - - --------------- cjh@austin.ibm.com writes ------------------------>

	This is simple,  He read the OSF documentation which did
	not claim it should not work, then the customer talked 
	with Rich Salz who claimed that it should work and that
	the IBM implementation was wrong.  I then researched the osf
	code which does not prohibit this during the config, but
	the rest of the osf support code, does not support the
	structure due to the assumption that /.:/<hosts> is the 
	ipaddress identifier.
	My take on it is to make it a restriction.
	And I belive everyone here will agree.

A support customer noted the following doc issues running a DCE 1.0.3
configuration.  

The following is from customer's DCE PROBLEM REPORT.
=====================================================================

Full Description:

 DESCRIPTION:
 whatis cannot find the following manpages:
 
 rdacl_get_mgr_types_semantics.3
 xom.h.4
 
 You can however, do a man on all these commands so it's not that the
 manpages are not on the system.
 
 REPRODUCIBLE: yes, do a whatis on any of the above commands on a R1.3
 system with DCE R1.0 installed.
  
 whatis cannot find the following two commands:
 
 	xom.h.4
 	rdacl_get_mgr_types_semantics.3
  
 > I think the xom.h one is a problem with more illegal nroff or troff commands
 > in the manpage.  Here is how it appears in the whatis database:
 > 
 > \*Lxom.h\*O (4xom)      - Header file for XOM
 
 > 
 > As for the rdacl_get_mgr_types_semantics.3, I wonder if there may be
 > an error in the manpage but I'm really not sure because I don't know
 > enough about how they work.  
 > 
 > Here is the way it looks in one of the temporary whatis database files
 > created during the execution of mkwhatis:

 > Should the text after "\fB" be rdacl_get_mgr... instead of rdacl_get_manager.
 >..?I noticed in the actual manpage that it also refers to rdacl_get_manager...

 Corrected typos referring to manager that should have
 been mgr.

     refer incorrectly to 
     rdacl_get_manager_types_semantics.3sec

==========================================
One Line Description : 
	Doc Error: rpc_server_use_all_protseqs does not list all errors 
		  returned.
Full Description : 
	The description for the routine rpc_server_use_all_protseqs
	in the OSF DCE Application Development Reference does not 
	list all the possible errors the could be returned, e.g.,
	rpc_s_no_addrs.

============================================

/project/dce/build/dcedoc1.1/src/dce_books/app_ref/man3rpc
		  /dcedoc1.2/

Both 1.1 and 1.2 app_ref areas for rpc_use_all_protseqs.3rpc list
the same errors. rpc_s_no_addrs, rpc_s_cant_bind_sock, 
rpc_s_invalid_rpc_protseq also appear to be valid return codes. 
This may not be a complete list.

In the section called ACL Entry Types for Masks and in subsequent
sections that discuss masks (The mask_obj Mask and ACL Checking
section and The Unauthenticated Mask and ACL Checking section), it
should be noted that not all components implement masks.  A note could
be added to the ACL Entry Types for Masks section that says something
like the following:
	A particular mask only applies to components whose ACL
	Managers implement it.  For example, the mask_obj mask is
	implemented in DFS but the unauthenticated mask is not.
and subsequent references to particular masks could be qualified to
note that they are used as filters only if they are implemented by the
ACL Manager.

In the section called Using the dcecp log Object, the definition of
the destination field of the serviceability_routing_specification says
that it may not contain colons (:).  This implies that that DFS
filenames can't be abbreviated /:/<file> but must be spelled out
/.../<cellname>/fs/<file>.  This fact should be stated directly to
avoid any confusion.

	cell could have the same UNIX number as the local principal
	and be seen by the local system as the owner of the local
	user's files on the local machine.
could be made into a new paragraph that describes this behavior in
terms of file systems, as follows:
	Thus, in file systems, such as LFS, that use extended
	credentials (which are communicated using secure RPC),
	foreign principals can be uniquely identified using their
	UUID.  But UFS is limited in what it is able to record about
	users; it holds just the UNIX number.  Therefore, an LFS file
	that is created by a foreign user is correctly reported as
	owned by that foreign user when examined with DCE tools.
	However the UNIX tools are only able to report the foreign
	principal's UNIX number, which may correspond to a different
	user in the local cell.
The next paragraph (which begins with, "Creating a UNIX number...")
could likewise be expanded, for example, it might be replaced with
something like the following:
	Since native UNIX file systems store only the UNIX number,
	they do not have the ability to uniquely identify foreign
	users, as LFS does.  For exported UFS partitions, DFS maps
	every foreign principal to the predefined principal, "nobody."
	The "nobody" principal is also used for unauthenticated
	access.  So the very feature that prevents foreign principals
	from accessing the local user's files also allows them to
	access each other's files.  With UNIX file systems, each user
	from a foreign cell is seen as the same user, every file on
	the local machine that is owned by a foreign user can be
	accessed by every other foreign user as well as by
	unauthenticated users.

The section called Reconfiguring the Cache Manager includes a bulleted
list that begins, 
	You can use the cm commands to perform the following tasks:

You can not use the cm command to change the cell membership.

Well, I'm not sure whom to assign this one to. But since the topic
has to do with the Cache Manager, I'm giving it to Transarc. Bill
(or Anne Jane), if this is wrong, let me know and I'll correct my
action.

The section called The dcceshared Subtree includes the paragraph that
follows.  Shouldn't the references to /opt/dce1.0 be updated to the
current version number?
The default pathname prefix for \*Vdceshared\*O is \*L/opt/dce\*O,
which is a symbolic link to \*L/opt/dce1.0\*O, or for DFS, to
\*L/:/opt/dce1.0\*O (the short form of \*L/.:/fs/opt/dce1.0\*O).  This
entry is always physically located at the local machine.  Therefore,
the local system administrator (or the respective software
administrator) must have write permission to modify this link.  You
can redirect this link from the fileset on the local machine to the
cell-wide accessible fileset as soon as the local machine is
configured and the cell is available; for example, redirect
\*L/opt/dce\*O to \*L/:/opt/dce1.0\*O.

In the section called Permissions Required to Delete Principals,

permission on the principal, group, or organization to be deleted, but
the figure indicates only D permission.  The figure should be modified
to say rD like the text.
Also, shouldn't this section be called Permissions Required to Delete

[4/29/96 public]
My mistake on the first two (labeled 0404 and 0414), they are actually
correct in my 1.2.1 tree.
The other three (labeled 0429, 0431, and 0432), however, are not
correct in my 1.2.1 tree (last sup'd on April 16).

[5/16/96 public]

Assigned to myself, since this all appears to be mechanical and
straightforward, and there is a mixture of actual responsibility
among providers for the material mentioned in the above.

The Admin Gd should be updated to use relative_time rather than hours
when referring to time-related attributes.  Specifically, in the Admin

maxtktlife and maxtktrenew attributes instead of relative_time.

Login Handling), it says that the ERA "disable_time_interval" is an
integer indicating the number of minutes the principal's account
should be disabled from login attempts.  This is incorrect; it is the
number of seconds, not minutes.

The documentation on the local registry found on pages 27-9 and 31-19
in the Adinistrative Guide - Core Components is misleading in that it
never explicitly states that this is only by the unified login when a
user is trying to log into a machine and the security registry is
down.
Also, the explanation on using the rgy_edit -l command never specifies
that you need to be root for the commands to work.

The DCE 1.1 Admin Guide states that the value of the disable_time_interval ERA
used for disabling invalid login attempts is the number of minutes the
account should be disabled for. This is incorrect. The value is 
the number of seconds, not minutes.

The section in Chapter 1 titled "File-Access Configuration" (page 1-2)
states "File Access consists of three programs: Client Utility, Gateway,
and Agent. These programs run on the NetWare client, NetWare server, and
DFS client, respectively." 

Other documentation (such as Figure 1-2) indicates that the Client Utility
runs on the NetWare server - not the NetWare client. That is, no File
Access software runs on the NetWare client.

The use of the "include" statement is described in the ACF chapter
(chapter 18) of the App Dev Guide-Core, but should also be mentioned
in the IDL chapter.
The IDL chapter (chapter 17) describes the "import" statement used to
import a file with the RPC IDL utility.  However, the "import"
statement reads in only "const," "typedef," and "import" statements
from the imported file.  To read in a whole file, byte by byte (as the
C preprocessor does), you can use the "include" statement in your .idl
file (where the included file contains valid IDL code).

More AES bugs to be fixed via DCE 1.2

---------- Begin Forwarded Message ----------

The AES text does not mention some "obvious" restrictions on the use
of identifiers:
  o parameter names should be unique in the parameter list of an
    operation or function type spec.
  o arm names should be unique in an case list
  o field names should be unique in a struct field list
  o union and struct tag names should be unique within an interface

I don't think the App Dev Guide does either..

Finally, neither the AES or the App Dev Guide says whether tag names
for typedef'ed union and struct types are imported, or whether
imported definitions can be redeclared.  Indeed, the AES gives the
syntax only for import!

got the free IDL stuff and is building some tools on top of it.

He is asking me (and Art H.) questions, as he runs into variances
between the 1.1 docs, the AES, and the idl compiler.  Code bugs I
am opening OT's for.  AES issues I am sending to Art.  I don't know
how you want to open OT's for AES work, which we (not HP or Digital)
own.  I know Art has already got a handful of fixes, so I've been assuming
that sending him (and maybe others) email is good enough to make sure that
these things don't get lost.

As part of the XIDL integration it was discovered/realized that idl_size_t
is an alias for size_t.  This OT suggests/request that either this 1:1
correspondence be documented in any porting info that we might
retain in 1.2 (in which case make this a doc defect) or that the code
be examined and idl_size_t be replaced with size_t.  (Perhaps some
platforms that the provider cares about don't have size_t "convenient.")

[10/6/95]
idl_size_t is not a type that is used as an RPC parameter. Its use
is to allow for the proper prototype for malloc in the memory
management APIs. There is no ndr representation for it. Therefore,
idl_size_t should be documented as such.

[10/12/95 public]

In any case, the idl_size_t datatype appears in the following DCE
Application Reference manpages:

    rpc_ss_allocate.3rpc
    rpc_ss_set_client_alloc_free.3rpc
    rpc_ss_swap_client_alloc_free.3rpc

--and in the "Interface Definition Language" (i.e., IDL) chapter
of the Application Guide core volume.

[2/4/96 public]

Assigning responsibility to myself. As I understand the situation
at the moment, idl_size_t should be documented, since it's going
to be retained. On the other hand, there is not going to be any
"porting info" as such for 1.2.1. The only place this information
could go would be the release notes somewhere (apparently it's in-
appropriate for it to be in something like rpc_intr(3rpc))

[9/15/95 public]

Bob Binstock pointed out that the .TH macro in the source for
svcdumplog.1dce contains the (incorrect) string "8dce" rather
than "1dce". He is correcting this now, but the incident brings
up again the question of what should be in the man1dce (as opposed
to the man8dce) directory in the first place; at the moment there
are only two manpages (sams.1dce and svcdumplog.1dce) there. Should
there be an intro manpage for it? Should there be a man1dce cate-
gory at all?

As I recall, the rationale at the time of DCE 1.1 was that man1dce
should contain DCE utilities not (or not necessarily) used by system
administrators, while the DCE system administration manpages should
go into man8dce. In practice this makes man8dce the dcecp manpage
directory.

(There is one exception to this, however-- the manpage for the
codeset registry compiler (csrc) is presently located in man8dce.
This seems to be wrong, if the reasoning in the previous para-
graph is correct; and the organization of the man1rpc directory
suggests that it is correct: that directory contains manpages for
uuidgen and the idl compiler, which are the two RPC commands used
not by system administrators, but by developers.)

Note that svcdumplog seems to fall into more than one functional
category: one can imagine it being used both by developers and by
administrators. So, even if its manpage stays in man1dce, it looks
as though there ought to be a cross-reference to it from log.8dce,
unless the dcecp log object offers the same functionality.

Finally, if svcdumplog.1dce is indeed in the right place, then it
looks as though csrc.8dce is in the wrong place, and should be
moved into man1dce.

[09/15/95 public]
The dcecp log object sets destinations or queries where a server is routing
messages.  If it sends them to a binary file, then svcdumplog can be used
to later display it in human-readable form.  So yes there should be a
cross-reference.

There aren't many DCE commands.  Certainly not compared to the API.  I
think man1rpc man1sec, etc., should all be collapsed into man1dce.  It
should be commands and user would normally use -- idl, uuidgen, svcumplog
maybe.  man8dce should have all commands only an administrator would use.
csrc, for example, is used only when new codesets are installed on the
machine -- an administrative activity.

It's hard to figure out what really belongs where.  Is someone who
develops a server a user or an administrator?  If a user, then dcecp
with all its server control is probably man1dce.  If the latter, then
man8dce.

Is it time to remove the unix-style numbering altogether?  DCE_CMD
for all DCE commands, for example, analogous to BA_CMD in the SVID?

[9/19/95 public]

.TH macro in file man1dce/svcdumplog.1dce now corrected to contain "1dce" 
instead of "8dce."  RELATED INFORMATION reference to "svcdumplog(1dce)"
has been added to file man8dce/log.8dce.

Reduced severity and priority, which didn't seem appropriate to the

In section 29.2.1 of the Application Dev Gd, it says:

"An application invokes sec_login_setup_identity() so that it can then make
other authenticated RPC calls.  However, sec_login_setup_identity() is itself
a local interface to an authenticated remote procedure call, and authenticated
RPC needs a validated login context in order to execute."

This is incorrect and should just be removed from the document.

App Ref description of sec_login_setup_identity() includes a note saying that
neither it nor sec_login_validate_identity() fail when an account has expired.
As of DCE1.1 that is no longer true (it never failed with either before, now
it fails correctly with sec_login_validate_identity() on the server side).  The
note should be removed (here and in the manpage and anyplace else it appears).

Admin Guide Core Components, section 30.9.1 "Creating Aliases" has
a bad error.  The "-alias" option is incorrectly explained and does
not show the required yes/no value.  The two examples are also
wrong.  The whole section, therefore, is misleading and unhelpful.

There are a couple of documentation problems that make password
strength management hard to use.

First, the example in section 30.6.3 (Adm Gd Core) on how to create 
a principal with a binding attribute for pwd_strengthd is probably wrong.
This example command fails when I try to execute it.  Because there 
is no documentation for the "binding" ERA type, I don't know for 
certain what a correct value for pwd_mgmt_binding might look like.

Second, there should be more discussion about the practical
problem of running a password strength server in a cell that includes
clients that may not support RPC privacy packet encryption.  This
problem is obvious when you look at the sample pwd_strengthd code and
think about what the auth_info field of pwd_mgmt_binding means.

Since export controls have resulted in a profusion of DCE products
without encryption support, documentation might do well to explain
a pwd_strengthd deployment strategy regarding this issue.  Initially, 
pwd_strengthd looks like it might just work out of the box.  For 
many users it won't.

[9/6/95 public]

Just noticed the section on password management in the release notes.
The caveat about using pwd_strengthd with a  "non-domestic" version
of DCE 1.1 because of the lack of password encryption is noted.
The note could be embellished to point out that most "domestic"
versions of DCE 1.1 lack password encryption as well.

The Admin Guide - Core Components, section 32.2.7 has a table (32-2)
that describes the predefined ERA encoding types.  The description
for the "binding" type refers the reader to the section called
"Defining Attribute Binding".  This section does not exist, and
I cannot locate any additional documentation that sufficiently
describes this type.

Section 4.3.7 of the App. Dev. Guide states that:

	you can suppress the "prolog" ... of all serviceability
	messages ... by setting the value of ... SVC_BRIEF to 1

I have not looked at the code but it certainly doesn't seem to be true
(i.e. I've tried it and it does not work that way) & OT11512 does state
that:

	the env variable only affects debug messages, not production

Which is right? If 11512 is the intended use then make this an enhancement
request to extend the reach to all svc messages. Otherwise this is a code
bug.

[5/17/96 public]

I am provisionally assigning this to myself since I wrote the
material originally and the question may be resolvable right here.
If not I will make the necessary re-assignment.

 There is a kernel-defined limit of 64 threads per process, by default.
 This can be modified by the customer via a rebuild of the kernel.
 This is an issue for any piece of multithreaded code running on
HI-OSF/M-1,
 not just DCE programs, but since it may arise in the context of DCE 
 we thought it worthy of mention.
 
 When this limit is hit, a variety of symptoms may ensue, depending very 
 much upon exactly when the program hits this limit.  From our tests,
 it would seem that the cdsclerk is prone to hitting this limit, but
 this probably reflects upon the nature of our tests more than anything
else. 
 (Although certain daemons may be implemented in a manner which, by luck,
 precludes this limit from being hit.) The DCE daemons themselves assume
 the ability to create threads at-will.
 
 When the cdsclerk does hit this limit, it might core dump in which case
name
 service access is resumed with a newly spawned clerk.  
 If it does not core dump, then a period of
 inactivity results in resumption of normal functionality as what were
 active threads gradually become available for reuse.

The following describes a quirk of ACLs on CDS directories.  I'm not sure
whether this
 really belongs in the acl_edit  man page, some CDS doc,  release notes, or
what.
 
 The problem:
 
 When specifying the permissions for ACL entries of the Initial Object ACL
on CDS directories,
 the user is allowed to turn on the "i" and "a" permissions.  The semantics
of these permissions
 are such that they simply do not apply to objects.  But being set in the
Initial Object ACL
 means that any object created in the directory will automatically inherit
them for its ACL.
 Attempts to modify the ACL on the object, other than to clear these bits,
will fail
 with no clear indication of exactly why.
 
 
 According to OSF, there are backward compatibility reasons for maintaining
this behavior
 on CDS Version 3 directories (e.g. OSF1.0.3 and below).
 
 REPRODUCIBLE:

I have no idea whether this bug is still valid. The CR escaped
notice for some time because of some incorrect coding. Anyway,
I'm assigning it to HP now.

[7/23/96 public]
Peculiarities of ACLs for a particular component are documented in that 
component's documentation.  The security ACL sections (including acl_edit and 
and dcecp acl) describe generic use.  I think this CR should be assigned to 
CDS.

Between the doc sets for 1.0.3 and 1.1, references to the ACF attributes
"in_line" and "out_of_line" were deleted, as were references to the
generation of auxiliary files (*_aux.o).  These changes are not mentioned
anywhere in the 1.1 docs, not even the release notes.  The only mention
that occurs is in the _docs_ section of the 1.0.3 release notes:

>     It is no longer necessary to account for .caux.o or
>     .saux.o files in the link step in Makefiles; the DCE
>     1.0.3 IDL compiler no longer generates these files. However,
>     by setting the environment variable IDL_GEN_AUX_FILES
>     as follows (in C shell):
>     
>         setenv IDL_GEN_AUX_FILES 1
>     
>     you can force IDL to generate empty aux files, thus
>     allowing pre-DCE 1.0.3 Makefiles to be used without
>     alteration with the new IDL compiler.

However, the man page for the 1.1 IDL compiler seems to imply that these
attributes are still valid and that auxiliary files are still generated 
under certain circumstances:

>      DESCRIPTION
>           The idl command invokes the IDL compiler to convert an
>           interface definition, written in IDL, into output files. The
>           output files include a header file, server stub file, client
>           stub file, and auxiliary files. The compiler constructs the
>           names of the output files by keeping the basename of the
>           interface definition source file but replacing the filename
>           extension with the new extension (or suffix and extension)
>           appropriate to the newly generated type of output file.  For
>           example, math.idl could produce math_sstub.c or math_sstub.o
>           for the server stub.

************

>      EXAMPLES
>            1.  Invoke  the  IDL  compiler  to  compile  the  interface
>                definition  file  test.idl  and  keep  the  generated C
>                source modules. Only server files are  generated.   The
>                server  stub default filename is overridden by creating
>                a file named test_ss.c for the server stub module.  The
>                server  auxiliary  default  filename  is  overridden by
>                creating  a  file  named  test_sa.c  for   the   server
>                auxiliary module.
> 
>                $ idl test.idl -keep c_source -client none -sstub test_ss.c -saux test_sa.c

If the IDL compiler no longer creates auxiliary files and no longer supports
the in_line and out_of_line ACF attributes, the man page should reflect this.
If this is _not_ the case, then the app dev docs (or at least the release
notes) should clarify what the real behavior of the IDL compiler in DCE 1.1
is.

[5/10/95 public]

        In dtss_service_global_set.c, when the dts server is unable
to call rpc_mgmt_inq_server_princ_name(), it free's the variable
serverPrincName.  The rpc runtime already does this if the calls
fails.  This is undocumented in the rpc_mgmt_inq_server_princ_name() 
man page.

Repeat By:

        Run dtsd in 'bad' conditions so rpc_mgmt_inq_server_princ_name fails
and notice a bad free.

Proposed Solution:

The rpc_mgmt_inq_server_princ_name() man page should document the
fact that the server_pric_name argument does not need to be free'd
if an error occurrs.

[5/17/96 public]

Assigned to HP. The sub-component value was missing up till
now, which is why the CR escaped notice.

One Line Description:

CDS does not build without -DDCE_SEC

Full Description:

The Porting and testing guide claims you should build CDS without
DCE security by turning off DCE_SEC (defined in cds.mk).

This doesn't work in DCE 1.1 due to various headers and C files
which use security types, etc without checking DCE_SEC.

A similar problem was reported for SVR4 against DCE 1.0.1 and fixed
(see OT 4405).

Repeat By:

Build cds component with -UDCE_SEC

Proposed Solution:

[5/17/96 public]

This was originally assigned to the Porting Guide, but that
book isn't supported anymore, so I'm designating the Release
Notes as sub-component.

 The following man pages have the "." (period) missing at the end of an
 ARGUMENT definition:
     For example:
 	cdscp_create_directory: "directory-name" - This implies that the
 				blurb summarizing the "directory-name" ARGUMENT
 				is not terminated with a "."; i.e.,

Full Description:

Related-file::Modified 941213 by julie:: Problem
 DESCRIPTION:
 The cdsadv(8cds) man page has an example that at first refers to the rpcd in
 release 3 and then to cdsadv in release 4. Either the rpcd information is
 superfluous or, if it is necessary, perhaps the user should be informed of
 that need.
 
 REPRODUCIBLE: Yes
 
 TEST SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION: man page review

 NAME

 EXAMPLE
      To restart a clerk, follow these steps:
 
       1.  Log in to the clerk system as superuser (root).
 
       2.  Log in to DCE as the machine principal of the local
           host. Enter the principal name in the format
           hosts/hostname/self as shown in the following example
           command for a host named orion whose password is smith:
           # dce_login hosts/orion/self smith
 
       3.  Enter the following command to see if the rpcd process
           is already running:
           # ps
 
           If the rpcd process appears on the list of active
           processes, proceed to release 4.  If the rpcd process does
           not appear on the list of active processes, enter the
           following command to start the process:
           # rpcd
 
 NOTE: This is the cdsadv man page, is this release necessary? If so, perhaps
       a brief explanation to the user would tie it together for clarity.
 
       4.  Enter the following command to start the cdsadv pro-
           cess:
 
           # cdsadv

Customer reported that the following man pages for cdscp:

        cdscp_add_directory(8cds)
        cdscp_add_object(8cds)
        cdscp_remove_directory(8cds)
        cdscp_remove_object(8cds)
        cdscp_set_object(8cds)

in the example section, tell the user to create/set/remove an attribute
that has notbeen created in the cds_attributes file:

"The cdscp_add_directory(8cds) man page suggests that the user try to use
 the "myname" attribute name, but the cds_attributes file in
 /opt/dcelocal/etc does not contain that entry." etc.

To me, the man page is clear enough to tell the user to verify that the
specified attribute is in the cds_attributes file before doing the example.
But the cutomer insists that the man pages have to say that if the
attribute is not in the cds_attributes file, one then should add the line.
I don't see the need, but since the customer insists on it, I will file
this reuqest to let whoever fixing this to decide what to do.

[7/5/95 public]

Assigned this to Digital for DCE 1.2, though perhaps the
right thing is to cancel this bug, since the DCE command
program manpages are obsolescent.

standard X options at its command level, like "-d DISPLAY", "-g GEOMETRY",
etc.

Aswini (here at T'arc) notes that case 3 in the acct_rename tests is
probably set up incorrectly. The comment and the C code for the suite
seems to expect the subcase to be ACCT_RENAME_ALREADY_EXISTS, but the
TSH for the subcase tries another ACCT_RENAME_NOT_FOUND .
 
At first glance, I can't immediately see how acct_rename subcases 2 and
3 ever both passed together. I'll keep looking..

[01/25/95 public]
When I was extending the security tests to test replication, I
uncovered a bunch of false passes and code which was not
exercised. I thought I fixed all of them but this was one that
I definitely missed.
Simply change the expected code in acct_rename.tsh for test 3 to
$ACCT_RENAME_ALREADY_EXISTS $sec_rgy_name_exists

[1/25/95 public]
sec_rgy_name_exists ? It looked (from the code) that it would be
sec_rgy_object_exists to me -- can you confirm which one?

[1/25/95 public]
Oh, now it's all coming back to me.
The man page for sec_rgy_acct_rename states that sec_rgy_name_exists
should be returned, so we changed the code in rsdb_acct_rename() to
return this error:
    /* To check if new account name exists, compare against full name (key_parts) */
    full_key_parts = sec_rgy_acct_key_org;
    if (account_exists(&person, &new_group, &new_org, full_key_parts, &last_account)) {
        SET_STATUS(status, sec_rgy_name_exists);
        return;
    }

[1/25/95 public]
  Not trying to be a pain -- bear with me. I've attached the code
fragment you refer to as seen in our current port of 1.1 . It still
reads the same as 1.0.3 did ... when you say the code has been changed,
do you mean in this "Warranty Release" I have been told to expect? And
if so, we have a concern here about this being a backwards-compatibility
bug now, as any coders outside that coded to the observed value instead
of the documented value are going to suffer. I'd dismiss them as having
coded against the spec, had not it been necessary to do so for 1.0.3
(and prior?) releases.
  Attachment:
-------------------------------------------------------
    /* To check if new account name exists, compare against full name (key_parts) */
    full_key_parts = sec_rgy_acct_key_org;

        return;

[1/25/95 public]
You're right, we can't change the error without breaking compatibility.
So, change acct_rename.tsh to:
$ACCT_RENAME_ALREADY_EXISTS $sec_rgy_object_exists
The man page for sec_rgy_acct_rename should be changed to expect
sec_rgy_object_exists instead of sec_rgy_name_exists.

OT 4401 indicates that both '#' and '!' are cdscp comment characters. It was
turned into a DOC bug, but man page for 'cdscp' only indicates that '#' is a
comment character, nothing about '!'.

Maybe it was due to the saying from OT 4401 that "The '!' is also a comment, 
but should be deprecated." that the doc fix did not include it. What is more,
for 1.0.2 and 1.0.3, you could use '!' as part of a cds name.

DCE 1.1 seems to do the right thing by changing '!' as a comment now. With 1.1
cdscp, both '#' and '!' act as comment. One can use dcecp to create a cds name
with '#' and '!' in it.

So, I think we need a clearer doc in cdscp man page about what are the comment 
characters. Also I think we need to say, in Appendix A of Admin Guide, the 
special characters in cdscp commands.

[5/17/96 public]

Assigned to Digital, though my understanding is that the documentation
for the old command interfaces is not being supported anymore, so per-
haps this CR should be cancelled.

This came out of "in what section to put command manpages" discussions over
the past week.  (Hal suggested opening a CR to track it.)

There has been suggestions to get rid of man1rpc.  This is wrong because
those commands (idl, uuidgen) are things an admin will probably never run.
(It's like putting the "cc" in 8.)

All commands that a user would us should be in section 1 of the manpages
in the DCE doc.  There are some in section 8 that belong in 1.  Historically,
section 8 is for admin-only commands.  If an ordinary user would use it,
(eg, dce_login), it goes in 1.  In other piles of unix commands, if
non-administrators use a command, it's manpage goes in 1.

"But what about dcecp?"  (Dian used to ask "but what about DFS?"...)
It's what administrators live for, but other users (esp developers) would
use it a lot also.

[11/1/94 public]

I sent mail out asking for comments on this, and got all of three, somewhat
contradictory.  One recommended against using the UNIX designators.  One
said to put the "commands in one place", The third said, ok to put them in
one place, but put the daemon docs in section 8.  Since any serious
rearrangement of the contents of this book would have a multitude of
effects on cross references, I am defering this to 1.2.  Also note that CR
10630 is related and the two should be resolved together.

[3/20/96 public]
This CR escaped recent detection because of its empty sub-component
field. I downgraded the severity/priority, changed the fixby date to
1.2.2, and assigned it to myself. It's related to the also-open CR
(13125) on where the svcdumplog manpage should be.

Appendix A in the Administration Guide - Introduction needs
to include the entry /.:/subsys/dce/pwd_mgmt/pwd_strength,
which is the location in CDS at which the password validation/
generation server pwd_strengthd stores its binding information.
The figure that illustrates the CDS namespace needs to be
modified to show this entry, and new tables that describe
the pwd_mgmt and pwd_strength entries need to be created
in the section that describes CDS namespace entries.

The following information, which will appear in the DFS portion of the DCE 1.1
Release Notes, needs to be corrected in the DFS documentation:
 
 In the \*EOSF DCE DFS Administration Guide and Reference\*O, descriptions of
 the various ID numbers used with the DFS Backup System are inconsistent and,
 in some cases, incorrect. Following are brief descriptions of the three types
 of ID numbers used with the Backup System:
 
 o A \*Edump ID number\*O is a unique number assigned to a dump set by the
   Backup System. The Backup System assigns a dump ID to each dump set created
   with the \*Lbak dump\*O command. It includes the dump ID in the tape label
   that it places on the tape with the dump; it then refers to the dump set by
   the dump ID for future Backup System operations. For example, when you
   perform a restore operation with the \*Lbak restoredisk\*O or \*Lbak
   restoreft\*O command, the Tape Coordinator requests tapes by tape name and
   dump ID. For this reason, it is prudent to mark the dump ID of a dump set
   on the tape that records that dump set.
 
 o A \*Ejob ID number\*O is a number assigned to an operation initiated with a
   \*Lbak\*O command. When you enter interactive mode, the \*Lbak\*O command
   polls the Tape Coordinators to determine all active and pending Backup
   System operations; it then assigns a job ID to each operation. In
   interactive mode, you can use the \*Lbak jobs\*O command to view the job IDs
   of active and pending operations. In interactive mode, you can also use the
   \*Lbak kill\*O command to terminate an active or pending operation once you
   know the job ID of the operation.
 
 o A \*Etask ID number\*O is a number assigned to an operation being performed
   by a Tape Coordinator (\*Lbutc\*O process). Each Tape Coordinator maintains
   its own sequence of task IDs, which is initialized when the Tape Coordinator
   is started. These numbers are of no consequence, but they can help you track
   the operations being performed by a specific Tape Coordinator.
 
 Keep these definitions in mind as you work with the DFS Backup System.

The Security Service portion of the admin guide may be incorrect in the
permissions that it lists for creating a new account.  We think that the
permissions should be as follows:
 
rmaug  on the principal named in the account
tm     on the group named in the account
tm     on the organization named in the account
r      on the registry policy object
 
We looked through the code, and these permissions seem to be correct.  Can
someone verify this and, if necessary, update the admin guide.

While doing this goes against my policy of not doing technical changes for
1.1 Prentice Hall, this seems to be a relatively high visibility change
that we can make.  If doing this is not easy, and confirming its technical
correctness is not easy, we should defer it to 1.2 again

still like to see if this can be fixed for 1.1PH though.....

This CR is asking for a slight re-org of a section of the docs and maybe a
couple more paragraphs.

Admin Guide - Core Components, CDS, Section 7.5 DCE Permissions Supported
by CDS.

the last paragraph and the following Note contains REALLY GOOD INFO.  It
should be more obvious to the user.  This info is about the ACL's that are
actually created on new objects.  The fact that it is not just the Initial
Object ACL of the parent container but also the creater is granted full
access based on the type of entry.

I'd like to see these paragraphs moved to section 7.3 How Permissions
Propagate to CDS Directories and Their Contents and I'd like to see it
organization in two subsections:

  7.3.1 The default ACL on new objects, softlinks, and clearinghouses
        Describe that the ACL is the IO of the container and the creater as
        found in the paragraphs from 7.5

  7.3.2 The default ACL on new directories
        Describe that the ACL and IC come from the IC of the parent and
        that the IO comes from the IO of the parent and the creater is
        granted rwidtca (also from 7.5)

Model this on what was Section 4.9.2 of the 1.0.3 Users Guide.  The
pictures are not necessary.  :-)

Customer reported a discrepancy between what the Admin Guide states
is the maximum size for a directory entry and what "cdscp create dir"
will actually accept.  I tested this against both 1.0.3 and 1.1 and
received syntax error messages when creating a directory with more
than 402 characters.  I dug around in the code a bit (see message
appended) and determined that this length restriction impacts quite
a few source files (and apparently only one page in the docs).

===========================================================================

I followed the source from the parsing of "cdscp create dir" down to the 
code which is actually generating the complaints about names being too long; 
it occurs in the cds_cvtCDSFullToOpq function in the CDS library file
dnscvtcdsfull.c.  Unfortunately, this is by no means the only file which
references FULLNAMEMAX or [CDS|DNS]_OPQ_FNAME_MAX; other affected files in
the cds tree include:

	/adver/adver_clerk_event.c
	/adver/adver_transport.c
	/adver/adver_service_ncl.c
	/cdsbrowser/cds_browsersource.c
	/control/name_actions_cds.c
	/control/preferred_clh.c
	/includes/cdsclerk.h
	/includes/dnsclerk_cds.h
	/includes/dns_record.h
	/includes/uc_parse.h
	/library/cdsstrings.c
	/library/dns_record.c
	/library/dnsgather.c
	/library/dnsmaxsize.c
	/library/dnsvalidate.c

This doesn't include cases where functions in other files might have the 
values of FULLNAMEMAX or [CDS|DNS]_OPQ_FNAME_MAX (or pointers to structures 
whose dimensions are defined by them) passed to them.

Obviously, changing these values from 402 (which I have to assume is some
weird VMS vestige) to the officially documented value of 1023 could break
a lot of code, and I would imagine that the 1.1 team might be understandably
reluctant to perturb the code base with such a change.  After searching OT,
our SC notes and the WAIS indices for DCE mail and docs, I came up with no
previous mention of this discrepancy between code and docs, so this must be
the first time anyone has actually tried to enter a name that long.  Sooner 
or later, though, someone is going to try to create a directory structure 
that looks like:

	All_the_spreadsheets_I_created_last_year/All_the_spreadsheets_I_created_last_quarter/All_the_spreadsheets_I_created_last_month/All_the_spreadsheets_I_created_last_week/All_the_spreadsheets_I_created_on_Monday/The_spreadsheet_I_created_at_10_am_that_the_boss_wanted_at_9_am

and they'll get those NOROOM/INVALIDNAME messages.

IBM feels strongly that we need better document in the CDS meta-character
area.

As OT 11064 indicates, "\" cannot be part of a name, even with another back
slash to escape it.  

It will be better to also have a paragraph which says, in plain words, what 
meta-characters, when escaped, can be part of a cds simple name; what meta
characters can not. One example is slash "/". The 1.0.3 doc does not
explicitly say that it cannot be part of a name, although one should be able
to conclude this by reading the doc (Appendix A of admin guide) since it
doesnot say that you can escape slash.

There are several problems:
1.) 

File /opt/dcelocal/var/directory/gds/dsa/dir3/dsaname could not be opened.

You get this when you stop tests in a critical status (i.e. when configuring
of dir. id 3 is in progress) and rerun them after this. 

2.)

Semaphore operation failed (operation = -1, errno = 28).

This happens if too much processes try to work with Semaphores.
Usually it happens if you hab=ven't started the tests from
a clean gds.
A fix for this is promised for the next submit - hopefully today.

We'll rerun the gdssetup tests ; we'll see what happens.

[07/20/94 public]
The system resource for the semaphore undo operation is too low.
A new kernel with a higher value must be built. On SVR4 we
have the following values:
	SEMMNU  200 (maximal number og processes with undo's)
	SEMUME   20 (maximal number of undo's per process)

[07/20/94 public]
It must be documented, that the final DCE product has to rebuild the
kernel during installation with the increased resource values
for the semaphores.

[7/22/94 public]
I don't agree that this is a doc issue and I don't agree that the solution
is to rebuild the kernel.  I would like to know why the solution is not in
the code.

[08/03/94 public]
This is my opinion:

A normal gds configuration (let's say 5 directory id's with the default
Client/Server configuration) works on all known UNIX machines -
nobody has to rebuild the kernel because of semaphores, ...
All gds testcases should run with the normal machine setup.

If somebody wants to use i.e. all 20 dir. id's each of them with
256 clients and 256 servers he probably can't do it with the
default setup. You have to change both : gds setup and machine
setup. gdssetup means i.e. IPC setup
(/opt/dcelocal/var/adm/directory/gds/adm/ipcconf - gdsipcinit
is started with the parameters from ipcconf - this is documented,
as far as I know). Machine setup means number of processes per user,
semaphore stuff, ...

So: my opinion: We should document what machine ressources are needed
per directory id, per client, per server, ... 

I repeat: All gds testcases should run with the normal machine setup.
I hope they really do.
OK, Rich?

All testcases do work now.
So it's a doc issue.

[08/18/94 public]
Reassigned to writer Rich Nollman.

[10/17/94 public]
All test cases now run with the normal machine setup. However, it should
be documented what system resources are required by various GDS
configurations. This cannot be done before the doc tree gets frozen.
Therefore deferred.

[7/12/96 public]

Assigned to HP. For some reason I missed the (obsolete) assignment to
Nollman until now.

[9/18/96 public]
Changed priority of GDS bug.

I sent mail to Lisa Z. about this, but there is a bug contest on.  :-)

Appendix A of the Admin Guide Intro Book (at least in 1.0.3) is a
description of the names in the DCE namespace.  The description of
/.:/sec/principal/hosts/hostname/self could be improved.  It is correct
that this is a well-known name, but it should be explained that only the
"self" part is well-known.  The first part the name of the host and what
is well-known is that given the name of a host there is a principal
beneath that name called "self".  There is nothing that says the
hostname couldn't be foo/bar resulting in the principal:

  /.:/sec/principal/foo/bar/self

What I'm trying to get across is that the "hosts/" part is not
well-known.

[7/25/94 public]

The descriptions of the well-known names in Appendix A of
the Admin Guide - Intro with "hosts" and/or "hosts/hostname"
in their paths need to note that these names are not well-known,
e.g., that

/.:/sec/principal/<hosts>/<hostname>/self

    could be

/.:/sec/principal/foo/bar/self

    because "hosts" and "hostname" are not well-known names,
    (but "/.:" and "principal" are, and I believe that "sec",
    although not well-known, is a recommended name.)
    
Clear (as mud?;-)

I'm assigning this CR to Susan Teto (OSF DCE config writer).

[8/1/94 public]
Close.  Please don't put "hosts" in <>'s, it's is a real name and it by far
"usually" is hosts.  We don't write other names are that are not well-known
in <>'s (italics?), only those names where we don't know the text.  E.g.:

  /.:/sec/principal/hosts/absolut/self 

That's a real name in my cell (my machine's name is "absolut"), the name
that should be in the appendix should be:

  /.:/sec/principal/hosts/<hostname>/self 

Since we don't know the name of the host at "press time".

You are correct on the treatment of "sec" and it is correct in the docs.
The only thing this CR addresses is that the description of the
hosts/<hostname>/self entry should be broadened to make it clear that the
host could be named anything (this includes the "hosts/" portion) and that
given a hostname the well-known part is that you can append "/self" to the
hostname to get the principal name:

I would normally name my host:  hosts/absolut

I *could* name it: machines/absolut or nodes/absolut

Given those names my "well-known" host principcal name would be:

machines/absolut/self or nodes/absolut/self  both under /.:/sec/principal/

[10/24/94 public]
Put fix forward to the Prentice Hall version of the Admin. Guide - Intro.

[10/24/94 public]
I am deferring this CR to DCE R1.2.  After re-examining the appendix (Appendix
A in the Admin. Guide-Intro.), I've concluded that the fix is not simple.
Moifying the description of the .:/sec/principal/self name, as zahn
indicates above, is not enough.  All the namespace entries need a similar
breakdown of the parts of their names.  These names can consist of
user-selected, recommended, and well-known parts.  We could add an
description of the names at the beginning of the appendix; we certainly
don't want to explain every name that appears in the tables contained
in the appendix.  But, an appendix is really not the place to present important
information like this, and we fail to address the real need: a description
of CDS names in the body of the Admin Guide.  Currently, there is none.
I looked through both the Intro. and Core volumes -- also, the Intro to DCE.
I don't think it is appropriate to put such information into the Intro to
DCE, but recommend that someone add it to Part II of the Admin. Guide-Intro,
perhaps in a new chapter with other overview info, for R1.2.  I recommend
this solution because the Core volume of the guide assumes right off
(in .../dcecp/language.gpsml) that the reader knows what the "self" name is.
There is also an allusion to the .:/sec/principal/self in the chapter of
the Intro volume on configuring DCE (8_config.gpsml), but this is in a
message that dce_config prints during initalization of the Security
server, and I think it can remain unexplained (see the "keyseed" input step).

Section 6.4.5 of Porting and Testing Guide describes a dts sync testing, 
where you collect trace info and then use dtss-graph to generate a ps report.

What this section does not tell is how to interpret the ps report. 
Also the section says that one can find a sample dtss-graph output 
in the distribution tape.

I tried going through 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3 tapes, 
but I could not find a sample output of dtss-graph.

I removed the erroneous reference to an example file, but the explanation

As a result of the Application Development Guide split,
cross-references to the Application Development Guide
need to be updated to reflect the new organization:

(1) Fix crossrefs to the old book title (App Dev Guide).
The right thing to do is to use the appropriate strings from bookdefs.mac.

(2) Fix internal crossrefs (chapter and section numbers).

Assigning this CR to Willie Williams, OSF book owner for
the Application Development Reference.

[09/30/94 public]
Reassigned to myself.

[09/30/94 public]
Changed severity/priority from "B1" to "C2".

[hal 10/24/94 public] Nearly all of the above has been done mechanically.
Manually verifying this is left as an exercise to the reader, but I have
appended a list of the changes to this note.  However there is ONE page
which still needs fixing:

app_ref/man3sec/sec_login_become_delegate.3sec

Here is the reduced log.  For better readability, I removed the

    <Note by yarsa (Julianne Yarsa), 93/08/26 12:47:57, action: open>
Need security manpage for sec_rgy_bind_from_towerv (Appl Dev Ref)

[4/11/94 public]
sec_rgy_bind_from_towerv() is declared in binding.idl along with the 
other public binding management routines. Since this interface is
exposed to applications, it should be documented appropriately.

I've recently learned (from Rob Stanzel) that sec_rgy_bind_from_towerv() 
was (is?) intended to be a private interface.  If so, it should not be
declared in binding.idl, but rather in a non-exported/non-installed file.
In that case it need not be documented.

[4/18/94 public]

I'm assigning this CR to Pam Millett (HP security writer) so
that she can coordinate with Rob Stanzel on whether this is
a doc CR (document routine) or code CR (move routine from public
declaration).

[4/18/94]

Added a cross-reference to CR10263 (document tower APIs)
per Hal's suggestion.

[8/29/94 public]
Changed status to defer and priority to 4 after consultation with 
rps and pato.

[6/30/95 public]

Re-assigned for DCE 1.2.

This CR covers the splitting of the Application Development Guide into
three books and all work for DCE 1.1 on the new Introduction and Style
Guide volume.

[4/4/94 public]

I've completed all the structural work for this.  Two pieces of remaining
work (among others):

(1) Fix crossrefs to the old book title (App Dev Guide).  The right thing
to do is to use the appropriate strings from bookdefs.mac.

(2) Fix internal crossrefs (chapter and section numbers).

I haven't tried to identify the internal crossrefs.  Following is a list of
definite or possible crossrefs to the book itself:

Reassigning this CR to myself for tracking purposes.
Related CRs are 10400, 10401, 10422, 10423, 10424, 01425, 10426.

[9/6/94 public]

Reassigned this CR to Julie Buckler, who is the
DCE 1.1 doc "bugmeister". She can use this CR
when verifying the related CR fixes. I also
changed the severity/priority from "A1" to
"B2" to match the other CRs related to fixing
cross-references.

[09/13/94 public]
Lowered severity to "C".

[10/27/94 public]
Changing "Fix By" to 1.1PH.

[9/14/95 public]

I suspect this bug is fixed, but I'm reassigning it to myself
for the moment and leaving it open until I can check to make
sure all the work has been done.

The description of the CDS_DirectoryVersion attribute in the show
clearinghouse man page (it appears in others as well, e.g. show replica) is
unclear: 

  Specifies the current version of the directory in the clearinghouse in
  which the directory was created.

I have no idea what this means.

[2/28/94 public]

Assigning this CR to Ron Johnson at Digital, as it's
my understanding from Hal Lichtin that he has taken
over responsibility from Diana Goldfarb for the CDS
documentation (as well as all of the documentation
that Digital is producing) for DCE 1.1.

[10/25/94 public]
Deferring this CR until 1.2.
The new descriptions of CDS_DirectoryVersion vary somewhat among
the three files listed in this CR.  The description should
probably be made standard.  Or at least, there should be a reason 
for not doing so.

[7/5/95 public]

Reassigned for DCE 1.2. This bug is not obsolete, since
Howard's original comment is still true of the clearinghouse.8dce
manpage. The directory.8dce manpage has the following definition:

  Specifies the current version of the directory (derived from the
  CDS_DirectoryVersion attribute of the clearinghouse in which the
  directory was created). Multiple directory versions are supported
  in a cell.

The cdscp documentation in the admin guide needs to be improved in the
following ways:

1.  Most examples, except for some of the show commands do not have the
generated output in the documentation.  The output of each command should
be shown AND DESCRIBED in detail.  The man pages that describe the show
command for each type of object do a decent job of describing each
attribute.  I would expect the admin guide to discuss how they work
together to define when skulking happens, etc.; how to examine a directory
to see when the last skulk was, when the next one will be, if something is
wrong, etc.

2.  The cdsbrowser documentation is almost identical to the documentation
in the users guide.  It should be referenced in one of the places.

3.  There is no documentation in the admin_gd on how to modify attributes
in any CDS object (object, directory, link, clearinghouse).  The add
command is not mentioned except in a long list of commands.  I would
probably include a new chapter between 10 and 11 that describes modifying
attributes of these objects.

4.  Chapter 11 seems to be a dumping ground of lots of information in only
12 pages.  It's entitled "Restructuring a Namespace" and includes creating
soflinks, modifying replica sets, deleting directories, moving
clearinghoues, and deleting clearinghouses all at about the same level of
discussion.  These are tasks of very different magnatude.

I would like to see the documentation as follows:

chapters for each of directories, objects, softlinks, and clearinghouses.
These 4 chapters would describe all the actions on each of these types of
CDS entries (create, delete, show, and adding attributes).  

The chapter on directories would include the existing info from chapter 12
on deleting directories with children, etc.  It should also describe how to
set up a namespace with the directories that you want.  This might be
better done in a begining chapter, but here is okay.

The chapter on clearinghouses should include the info from chapter 11 as
well on how to move clearinghouses, etc. 

Another chapter on replication that describes how to set up replicas, how
to move, delete, backup, etc.  Also needed in this chapter is planning
information on how many replicas would be needed, etc.  I would include all
of chapter 5 (all 2.5 pages) in this chapter, and be sure to include
information on setting up skulks to happen at correct times (and enough
information to help an admin determine what the correct time is!).

To summarize, I would first have a chapter for each type of CDS entry that
describes individual commands and what they do.  Then I would have
chapters/sections that describe administrative tasks that need to be
performed, including planning, designing the namespace, designing
replication, moving replicas and clearinghouses, backups, etc.

[9/2/93 public]

I agree that much of the preceeding is desirable, but feel that it really
should be considered an enhancement.  I have therefore changed this to an
enhancement request and changed the severity/priority to C4.  If any pieces
of the above should be considered a defect (e.g., if there is any missing
information that is required), a more specific defect request should be
opened for that particular piece.

Digital is responsible for this documentation and has indicated to me that
they do not have the resources to do this work in 1.1.  I do not want to
cancel or close this bug, as the request is reasonable, but I do not think
that it can be addressed in 1.1.  I am therefore marking this as defer (and
priority D), but leaving it as Fixby 1.1.

[3/29/94 public]

Reassigned this CR to Ron Johnson (DEC DCE 1.1 writer).

[hal 9/19/94 public

Now defering this to 1.2.  Note some of the requests in this CR are no
longer applicable.  Here is my quick assesment: Item 1 may still be
applicable to the "dcecpized" documents.  The 1. current versions of the
docs should be analyzed to determine the needed work.  Item 2 is moot, as
the User Guide is gone.  Item 3 dups CR 10405.  Item 4 may still be valid;
same comments apply as with item 1.  The overall request should also be
reviewed.

[7/5/95 public]

Reassigned for DCE 1.2.

	Section 11.3.1 is better than section 11.3.2 (settin gup gds), but it
still lacks some important steps to get DNS to work for the inter-cell comm
purpose. The following write up is a detailed description for what to do.




Q: I have configured two or more cells, if I want to connect them
   using DNS, how do I start? What problems could I run into?

A: There are two ways for a GDA on one cell to find information about another
   cell; either through DNS, or through X.500. We give information on how
   to use DNS here. The information can be found in Section 11.3 of Admin
   Guide, Module 3.

   In order for a GDA to find information about another cell via DNS,
   the GDA must be able to contact a DNS server machine (running
   either BIND or named) which has been configured such that it knows some
   important facts (most notably, the IP address of the machine on which
   the cds clearinghouse is running and the UUID of the cds clearinghouse) 
   about the cells which wish to interoperate. The DNS server machine does
   not need to be a member of either DNS cell. However, each cell's GDA(s)
   must be able to locate the DNS server machine by looking up its IP address
   in a resolv.conf file.

   The system administrator obtains the UUID of the cds clearinghouse
   by using the cdscp command (see section 11.3 of the Admin Guide, Module 3,
   Section 11.3.1). For example, to obtain the UUUID for a cell named
   gaia_cell, you would do the following.

# cdscp show cell /.../gaia_cell as dns
                        SHOW
                        CELL   /.../gaia_cell
                          AT   1993-01-26-14:34:06
                         TXT = 1 7D1162A8-F6E8-11CB-B3A4-08002B2A232C   Master
/.../gaia_cell/gaia_ch 7B13C25C-F6E8-11CB-B3A4-08002B2A232C

**   Note that the above information will change, each time DCE is
installed,      **
**   requiring a corresponding update to the configuration file of the
DNS server. **

   You also need to find out the IP address of machine on which the cds
   clearinghouse is running. You can do so with the "nslookup" command. For example,
   you could obtain the IP address of host gaia, by doing the following.

# nslookup gaia
Server:  pooch.osf.org
Address:  130.105.1.156

Name:    gaia.osf.org
Address:  130.105.1.107

   After acquiring this information about a cell which wishes
   to interoperate with other cells, it must be entered in the DNS
   server configuration file at the DNS server machine, the
   details of which are implementation specific.

** Note that if your nameserver configuartion file contains an SOA      **
** (Start of Authority) record, then you should update the serial       **
** number in this SOA record, each time you change the file's contents. **

   In our case, we were able to accomplish this by creating two AFSDB records
   (per cell) in the file /var/domain/qadce.hosts on host venus, our
   DNS server. For example, the following records were added to describe
   cell gaia_cell whose cds clearinghouse was running on machine gaia. 

gaia                    IN      A       130.105.1.107
                        IN      MX      10 postman.osf.org.

gaia_cell               IN      MX      1 gaia.qadce.osf.org
                        IN      TXT     "1 7D1162A8-F6E8-11CB-B3A4-08002B2A232C
   Master /.../gaia_cell/gaia_ch 7B13C25C-F6E8-11CB-B3A4-08002B2A232C 
gaia.qadce.osf.org"

   Of these records, the first MX-A pair specifies the host IP address of gaia
   and its mail exchanger, the second MX-TXT pair specifies information about
   the cell; its  ns uuid, replica type, clearing house name, and
   clearing house uuid. 

** Note that this example, like the one in the Admin Guide, assumes that          **
** the DNS configuration file contains AFSDB records, which is a newly proposed   **
** record format for BIND. Unfortunately some named's do not support this record  **
** format.

   After you have modified its configuration file, you need to recylce
   named such that it will read it's modified configuration. On venus, we
   were able to recycle named by performing the following sequence of
   operations.

# /sbin/init.d/named stop

       wait a couple of seconds

# /sbin/init.d/named start

   After you have modified the configuration file you can use nslookup
   to verify that the correct information is available from named.

$ nslookup
Default Server:  venus.qadce.osf.org
Address:  130.105.5.19

> set querytype=any
> gaia
Server:  venus.qadce.osf.org
Address:  130.105.5.19

gaia.qadce.osf.org      inet address = 130.105.1.107
gaia.qadce.osf.org      preference = 10, mail exchanger = postman.osf.org
postman.osf.org inet address = 130.105.1.152
postman.osf.org inet address = 130.105.4.20
> gaia_cell
Server:  venus.qadce.osf.org
Address:  130.105.5.19

gaia_cell.qadce.osf.org preference = 1, mail exchanger = gaia.qadce.osf.org
gaia_cell.qadce.osf.org TEXT=1 5458A47D-2850-11CC-81F3-08002B2A232C   Master /..
./gaia_cell/gaia_ch 52707B80-2850-11CC-81F3-08002B2A232C gaia.qadce.osf.org
gaia.qadce.osf.org      inet address = 130.105.1.107
	 
   As mentioned previously, each machine on which a GDA is running, must be able
   to locate the DNS server machine by looking up its IP address in a resolv.conf
   file. For example, to make it possible for the GDA running on gaia to
   locate the DNS server on venus, we configured the resolv.conf file on gaia
   such that it contained the IP address of venus.

# cat /etc/resolv.conf
;
; BIND data file.
;
nameserver      130.105.5.19
domain          qadce.osf.org

   Finally, in order to allow the cells to authenticate principals from their
   interoperating cell, we used the rgy_edit cell command to "cross authenticate"
   each pair of interoperating cells.  For  example to "cross_authenticate" cells
   gaia_cell and pierrot_cell from cell gaia_cell, you would do the following.

$ dce_login cell_admin
Enter Password:
Password must be changed!
$ rgy_edit
Current site is: registry server at /.../gaia_cell/subsys/dce/sec/master
rgy_edit=> cell /.../pierrot_cell
Enter group name of the local account for the foreign cell: none
Enter group name of the foreign account for the local cell: none
Enter org name of the local account for the foreign cell: none
Enter org name of the foreign account for the local cell: none
Enter your password:
Enter account id to log into foreign cell with: cell_admin
Enter password for foreign account:
Enter expiration date [yy/mm/dd or 'none']: (none)
  Principals and Accounts have been created
rgy_edit=> q
bye.
$

** Note that the rgy_edit cell command need only be performed on one side **
** of each interoperating pair.                                           **
 
   If you have any trouble with the cell command, make sure the following are 
   true.

   1. you have correctly configured venus, down to the last '.'
   2. Your GDA (gdad) is running.
   3. The two cells have system times which are less than 5 minutes apart.
   4. Note that the section "4.5.1.3 Using gdad" describes command line options
      of gdad which can be used to diagnose problems in your intercell setup.
   5. Note that if you are running a local name server (not a resolver),
      gdad will need to locate a file which stores the names of the BIND root
      nameservers. By default, gdad assumes that this file is named
      "/opt/dcelocal/etc/named.ca". gdad can be instructed to use the
      "root.cache" file, present in recent versions of BIND, in the place of
      named.ca by using the -s option of gdad.

I spoke with Diana Goldfarb (Digital DCE writer) about
this enhancement today. She says that Digital is interested
in making this enhancement to the documentation but will not
be able to do it in the 1.0.3 timeframe. They will consider
making the enhancement in the DCE 1.1 timeframe. Consequently,
I have changed this CR from "open" to "defer" and have marked
the fixby date as "1.1".

[10/5/94 public]
Digital has indicated that they will not be fixing this for 1.1.  Defer to
1.2.

Reassigned for DCE 1.2.

	Section 11.3.2 is much too simple to be useful. The following is my
write-up of what to do (step by step) for settin gup GDS for inter-cell.


		  Inter-Cell Communication Through GDS


	There are two ways for a GDA on one cell to find the information about
another cell in the world. One is through DNS, the other is through GDS, or
X.500. OSF DCE's Administration Guide Section 11.3 gives a relatively 
detailed description on how to set up DNS for this purpose. The part for 
setting up GDS for this purpose is too simple to be useful.

	There is already a Q&A on how to use DNS with step to step instruction.
We describe here the steps necessary to set up GDS to serve the inter-cell 
communication purpose.

	CDS passes to gdad a foreign cell name. Depending on the format of the
name, i.e., whether it is a GDS/X.500 name or a DNS name, gdad does things 
accordingly. Contrary to some belief that one can set up either DNS or GDS for
inter-cell communication, whether DNS or GDS is used is determined by the gdad
at runtime from the name structure. This means if you want to contact a cell 
with GDS/X.500 name, you have to have GDS set up; if you also want to contact 
a cell with DNS name, you will also have to set up DNS.

	For a GDS name cell, gdad spawns a subprocess to run gda_child, which 
contact local GDS client to retrieve the required cell information. gda_child
returns the necessary information back to gdad, which in turn returns the
information to cds.

	A little bit words on GDS, an implementation of X.500 from OSF DCE 
offering: GDS has a client/server model. A GDS server can be run on any node 
in the network, and you can run as many servers as you want. A GDS server is 
where the directory information is actually stored. A server is at the same
time a GDS client. Similarly, a GDS client can reside on any machine in the
network. After initial set up, a client can contact any DSA, a GDS server.

1. Setting Up The GDS Server

	For the inter-cell communication purpose, you need at least one GDS 
server. It does not need to run on any of the machine in any cell. Let's say 
we run it on machine S1. Here are the steps you need to do to configure a GDS 
server (of course, it is assumed that GDS binaries have been installed on S1).
Remember, you have to be root:

1.1. start "gdssysadm"

	a. Select "c" for configuration, then configure as a Client-Server
	   system (for detailed description of how to do this, see Chapter 14
	   of DCE Administration Guide). The following shows a sample values:

	If you are using 1.0.2 GDS:

	Now you are in Mask 6d. You can use arrow keys to move the highlight
	bar. Use <CR> to make the selection.

	Choose DSA-Type by moving to "DSA-Type" and type <CR>, Now hit <F2>
	to get into the attribute screen Mask 7.

	If you are using 1.0.1 GDS, you will get Mask 7 and you need to type
	in "DSA-Type" as an attribute name yourself in order to have this
	attribute.

	Now you have done the initialization for the local DUA to create a
	DSA.

	Now from Mask 1, logon to the default DSA:

	If you are using 1.0.1 GDS, you will get into Mask 7 for attributes.

	Since we don't need any attributes here, just type <F2> if you are 
	using 1.0.2 GDS. Hit a couple of <CR>s if you are using 1.0.1 GDS.

	Again, you need to choose what attributes you want to add. Since this
	(c=us/o=osf/ou=osfsun) is the cell name we want to add, we need to add
	the cell information as attributes).

	For 1.0.2 GDS, choose from Mask 6d "CDS-Cell" and "CDS-Replica" by
	using arrow keys to move the highlight to the proper entries and hit
	<CR>. Then hit <F2>.

	For 1.0.1 GDS, enter "CDS-Cell" and "CDS-Replica" as two attribute
	names. Hit a couple of <CR>s until the next screen shows up.

	Before you go on, you need some information of the cell. You can get
	it by going to any machine in the c=us/o=osf/ou=osfsun cell and do the
	following:

$ cdscp show cell /.:/ as gds
                        SHOW
                        CELL   /.../c=us/o=osf/ou=osfsun
                          AT   1993-07-01-14:31:17
              Namespace Uuid = 007C6B54-58AD-1C2F-A096-000082690138
          Clearinghouse Uuid = 003A23C0-58A8-1C2F-A096-000082690138

                       Tower = ncadg_ip_udp:130.105.1.56[]
$

	You leave this information handy in another window for cut and paste.

	Now you are in Mask 21. It asks you to enter namespace UUID, the root
	dir UUID, and root dir name. As you may notice, there is no root dir
	UUID from the above display. Actually, it is the same as namespace
	UUID. It is a historical reason that it is left here. Don't worry.

	From Mask 4, choose "0" to exit. Choose "3" from Mask 3 again. Then
	Ctrl-C to get out of gdsditadm.

	Believe it or not, you have just finished setting up the GDS server
	for inter-cell communication purpose. Congratulations.

	Need to take a break? By all means ...


2. Setting Up The GDS Client

	As mentioned before, the GDS server can be run on any machine. If you 
want to communicate from cell C1 to cell c=os/o=osf/ou=osfsun, you also need a
GDS client to talk to the server who has the information about cell
c=us/o=osf/ou=osfsun.

	The GDS client needs to run of the machine in the cell C1 where the CDS
server runs, since that is the machine where gdad will run.

	Note, if you run GDS server on the machine where CDS server runs, you
are all set, since a GDS server is also a client itself.

	Again, you need to configure the client and create the default DSA. 
Here is what you do:

2.1 Configuring client with "gdssysadm"

	a. Choose "c" for configuration of a directory system, then configure
	   as a Client system (for detailed description, see Chapter 14 of DCE
	   Administration Guide). The following shows a sample values:

I spoke with Diana Goldfarb (Digital DCE writer) about
this enhancement today. She says that Digital is interested
in making this enhancement to the documentation but will not
be able to do it in the 1.0.3 timeframe. They will consider
making the enhancement in the DCE 1.1 timeframe. Consequently,
I have changed this CR from "open" to "defer" and have marked
the fixby date as "1.1".

[3/29/94 public]

Reassigned this CR to Ron Johnson (DEC DCE 1.1 writer).

[10/4/94 public]

This should probably have been SNI's.  I'm reassigning, and will consult on
defering it.

[10/26/94 public]
defering to 1.2.  Really applies to CDS so....

The cdscp.8cds man page should describe how multivalued attributes are
displayed via the various show commands, it is not at all obvious from the
display(particularly when there is only one value): 

           CDS_CHDirectories = :
           UUID of Directory = 00495cc9-6827-1bb3-8d8b-08002b0f59bb
           Name of Directory = /.../absolut_cell
           CDS_CHDirectories = :
           UUID of Directory = 0001c958-68eb-1bb3-8d8b-08002b0f59bb
           Name of Directory = /.../absolut_cell/subsys

[07/06/93 public]
Assigned this CR to Diana Goldfarb.

[10/13/93 public]
[verified by Alan Peckham]

Added the following information to cdscp.8cds in the Admin_ref,
and to 9_cds_view.gpsml in the Admin_gd:

        When you display an attribute that has more than one value, the
        show command lists each value separately.

[10/13/93 public]
If all that changed was adding the one sentence described above then this
is not enough.  I want to see an example.  The fact that the attribute is
listed twice and that the Attribute Type will appear on two different
lines.  The fact that a colon is used to indicate that there are multiple
values.  In the example I gave:

           CDS_CHDirectories = :
           UUID of Directory = 00495cc9-6827-1bb3-8d8b-08002b0f59bb
           Name of Directory = /.../absolut_cell
           CDS_CHDirectories = :
           UUID of Directory = 0001c958-68eb-1bb3-8d8b-08002b0f59bb
           Name of Directory = /.../absolut_cell/subsys

I should be VERY clear to the reader that the CDS_CHDirectories attribute
contains two pieces of information, a UUID and a Name, and that there are
two values shown here.

[10/21/93 public]

No change was made to the Admin Guide "Viewing Content
and Structure of the Namespace" chapter (9_cds_view.gpsml).

The change made to the cdscp man page is as follows:

 All entities have show commands that you can use to
 display the names and values of specific attributes
 or all attributes. When you display an attribute that
 has more than one value, the show command lists each value
 for the attribute separately.

This change does not provide enough information about how
to interpret cdscp show command displays of multi-valued attributes
to consider it a "fix" to the CR. Per Hal Lichtin's instructions,
I am reopening this CR and assigning it to Diana Goldfarb.

[11/8/93 - changing to fix pending OSF verification of change]

Howard's point is well taken.  I have taken his example and added it, along 
with an explanation, to 9_cds_view.gpsml.  The new text is as follows:

  The following command displays the current values of the CDS_Directories
  attributes associated with the \*L/.:/Chicago2_CH\*O clearinghouse.  In this
  example, the display for the command shows two values for the attribute.
  The parts of the attribute values for the attribute are UUID of
  Directory and Name of Directory.  The command displays the values
  separately.  For each value, the command first lists the attribute name
  on a line ending with a colon, then the parts of the value. 

     cdscp> show clearinghouse /.:/Chicago2_CH CDS_UTS

           CDS_CHDirectories = :
           UUID of Directory = 00495cc9-6827-1bb3-8d8b-08002b0f59bb
           Name of Directory = /.../absolut_cell
           CDS_CHDirectories = :
           UUID of Directory = 0001c958-68eb-1bb3-8d8b-08002b0f59bb
           Name of Directory = /.../absolut_cell/subsys

[11/8/93 public]
I would make one change for clarity, where you have:

  The parts of the attribute values for the attribute are UUID of
  Directory and Name of Directory.  The command displays the values

I would change this to:

  The parts of the attribute values for the attribute CDS_CHDirectories are
  UUID of Directory and Name of Directory.  The command displays the values

Also the first line has CDS_Directories, not CDS_CHDirectories.  Also, I
believe that the command line is in error.  Where it says CDS_UTS it should
probably say CDS_CHDirectories.  Please TRY the command line to see if it
produces what we think it does.

I have some concerns that only an example is given and that the
generalization is not clear.  The goal is to describe how multivalued
attributes and attributes with multiple parts are displayed, not just give
an example of CDS_CHDirectories.  For example, what I don't get out of the
above text, is how do I know when the listings of attributes with parts
end.  I know they start with a line that has the attribute and a : and that
the values follow.  How do I know how many parts are in the attribute
value?  For example, how do I know from the output that there are two parts
in each value of a CDS_CHDirectories attribute?  What if there were only
one value? (That isn't a typo, CDS_CHDirectories happens to be both
multivalues and each value has more than one part.)

Finally, I would really like to see this info in the both the guide and the
reference pages.  When I'm playing with cdscp and trying to figure out its
output, I'm more likely to say "man cdscp" than to open the admin guide.

[11/10/93 - verified by janet mccann]

Thanks, Howard, for catching the typos. I've changed CDS_Directories
to CDS_CHDirectories and corrected the command line.  In addition, I
added to the example the beginning lines of the cdscp show clearinghouse
command display for completeness.

For clarity, I have changed the following sentence in 9_cds_view.gpsml
by removing the redundant words "for the attribute."

  OLD:  "...The parts of the attribute values for the attribute are
        UUID of Directory and Name of Directory."

  NEW:  "...The parts of the attribute value are UUID of Directory and Name
        of Directory."

I have also the changed the revised cdscp.8cds text to read as follows:

        "All entities have \*Lshow\*O commands that you can use to
        display the names and values of specific attributes or all
        attributes. When you display an attribute that has more than one
        value, the \*Lshow\*O command lists each value for the attribute
        separately. For each value, the command first lists the
        attribute name on a line ending with a colon, then the
        components of the value."
        
Howard comments that "the goal is to describe how multivalued attributes
and attributes with multiple parts are displayed, not just give an
example..."   He asks ..."how do I know when the listings of attributes
with parts end [sic]... How do I know how many parts are in the attribute
value?..how do I know from the output that there are two parts
in each value of a CDS_CHDirectories attribute?  What if there were only
one value?" To Howard's questions we might add: How do I know when the
attribute parts have subparts, and where they begin and end?

It turns out that the cdscp display of attributes is ambiguous. There is,
apparently, no way to describe how to read the output.  This is not a
problem documentation can solve.  For the time being, the best
documentation can do is address the simple issue with the simple
statement and recommend opening a CR against the software.

[11/10/93 public]
I was fearful of that but not positive.  Okay, then we should tell the
reader that sometimes it can be hard to figure out where things end.  There
are a few hints we can mention.  First of all CDS attributes all begin with
CDS_, that is all the attributes defined by CDS, not by users, RPC defines
some as well, and those begin with RPC_.  The parts of attributes that have
multiple parts (not values) have a "type" that does NOT begin with CDS_.
Here's the same example:

           CDS_CHDirectories = :
           UUID of Directory = 00495cc9-6827-1bb3-8d8b-08002b0f59bb
           Name of Directory = /.../absolut_cell
           CDS_CHDirectories = :
           UUID of Directory = 0001c958-68eb-1bb3-8d8b-08002b0f59bb
           Name of Directory = /.../absolut_cell/subsys

You can tell that the attribute is CDS_CHDirectories and that it has two
parts, neither of which begin with CDS_.  To find out what the defined
attributes are the user can look at the /opt/dcelocal/etc/cds_attributes
file.  Now, I'm pretty sure that the file is implementation specific, i.e.,
it is this way on the reference ports.  Also note that /opt/dcelocal is
usually written as dcelocal in italics (things like this often get screwed
up, so I'm just trying to be complete).

Also, the only "multi-part" attributes that will be displayed are those
that are in CDS defined attributes since the display of these things
happens in cdscp code.  Given that, we know which parts can be output and
which attributes have parts.  We can list this stuff.  Note that if a user
defines a new attribute with parts, unless they modify cdscp, it will only
be displayed as a "bunch of bytes".

You can tell how many values an attribute has, because the attribute type
will be repeated that many times.

Can we do something like this?

[11/19/93 public]

(This bug was inadvertently closed.)

The cdscp display of attributes is ambiguous. Either
the cdscp code could be changed to remove the ambiguity,
or the documentation could be enhanced to explain the
ambiguity. Diana Goldfarb is consulting with Janet McCann
about whether or not cdscp may be fixed. Meanwhile, I am
reopening this bug, but changing the "fixby" date from 1.0.3
to 1.1, since there is not enough time to fix it for the
1.0.3 shipment.

[1/18/94 public]

Changed this CR to an engineering CR, per Mary Jane Grinham's
instructions (M.J.G. is DCE 1.1 documentation project manager).

[7/5/95 public]

Reassigned for DCE 1.2.

[08/20/96 public]
I'm re-assigning this back to doc since cdscp is being obsoleted by
dcecp and no further enhancements for cdscp are planned (especially
in changes of display), although I do agree that the cdscp output
is poor.  Documentation can close this OT if they think so.

Tony received a request from someone to explain (and give an
example if possible) the purpose of the ACF heap attribute.
The App Gd explains how to use it but not why you'd want to.

This bug relates to an IDL aux control file.  I think it belongs 
to DEC.

Reassigned to writer Steve Lewontin.

[3/29/94 public]

Reassigned this CR to John Shirley (OSF RPC writer) from
Steve Lewontin, although it seems that the responsibility
to address this CR really belongs to DEC, who owns the IDL/ACF
documentation.

[6/8/94 public]

Reassigned this CR to myself - I'm the OSF writer responsible
for the IDL documentation.

[9/15/94 public]

Due to DCE 1.1 resource and schedule constraints, this
CR is being deferred. CR10547 provides a workaround
to a specific enhancement for the heap attribute
documentation, namely, that the documentation needs
to say that the heap attribute is ignored for scalars,
pipes, and context handles.

Review comment from Howard, need a picture of DFS from the
administrator's point of view in Admin Gd - Intro, section
2.5.1 "The DCE Distributed File Service".

[6/1/93 public]
Reassigned to writer Jeff Kaminski since Jennifer is no longer at OSF.

[6/1/93 public]
The above should say 1.0.1 Admin Guide Module 1 Chapter 2 section 2.1.5
"DCE Distributed File Service" page 2-10.
I found the text description of all the different DFS servers and
components (LFS on some machines, the client side is called the "cache
manager") sufficiently long enough and complex enough for a new reader,
that a picture is probably in order to make it easier for them.  There are
already pictures in this chapter for CDS and DTS relationships, one for DFS
seems justified.

[6/18/93 public]
In reviewing the open defects and work to be performed for releases 1.0.3 and
beyond, I can with confidence state that there is really no way I will ever
get to this enhancement.  It's a good idea, but this really isn't even my
portion of the Admin Guide, and I know I won't be able to get to it.
I am reassigning it to Julie at OSF to reassign to someone else up there as she
sees fit.  I am also lowering the priority a tad (B 2 seems a bit high for an
enhancement request for an illustration).  Sorry for bouncing this request; in
light of the technical work to be done in the books for which Transarc has
direct responsibility, sending this enhancement back is the most honest
approach I can take.  Please let me know of any concerns you have with this
change.  Thanks.

The dfs-server principals for all DFS machines are by default members of a
cell-wide dfs-admin group (which may have some involvement with the cell_admin
identity).  Because of this, the local root user on a machine can use the
-localauth options provided with a number of commands to masquerade as the
local machine, assuming the privileges granted to the machine by virtue of
its inclusion in the dfs-admin group.  Possible effects of the default
configuration and machines' inclusion on DFS admin lists need to be
documented; the documentation is, however, an enhancement at this point.

[5/19/94 public]
The following information related to this defect was taken from defect 8118:
 
 Many commands in the \*Lbos\*O and \*Lfts\*O command suites include a
 \*L-localauth\*O option. The option allows you to direct the \*Lbos\*O or
 \*Lfts\*O program to use the DFS server principal of the machine on which the
 command is issued as the identity of the issuer of the command. Because the
 command executes with the identity of the machine, the DFS server principal of
 the machine from which the command issued must be included in the necessary
 administrative lists; otherwise, the command fails. For example, including the
 \*L-localauth\*O option with a \*Lbos\*O command issued from machine \*Lfs1\*O
 to machine \*Lfs2\*O succeeds only if the DFS server principal of machine
 \*Lfs1\*O is included in the \*Ladmin.bos\*O list on machine \*Lfs2\*O.
 
 To simplify this requirement, create a group that contains all DFS server
 principals and include that group in the \*Ladmin.fl\*O, \*Ladmin.bos\*O, and
 \*Ladmin.ft\*O lists on all trusted DFS server machines in your cell. If your
 cell includes administrative domains, the latter two lists may require special
 domain-specific groups.
 
The information is included here so that I can avoid duplication of the same
defect information and so that I can close defect 8818.

[5/25/94 public]
The following notes also pertain to this defect.  I am including the text here
so that all of this information can be considered together when the time comes
to address the defect:
 
  The documentation needs to be updated to include that DFS server processes
  run as the dfs-server principal of the machine on which they are configured.
  Especially note that the documentation of the bos commands for admin lists
  needs to be corrected to mention that the dfs-server principals of machines
  that run DFS processes need to be included in lists for those processes to
  be able to work on the machine. For example, lists such as admin.up must
  include the dfs-server principals of machines that run upclient to access
  files from the machine.
 
  On a similar note, the dfs-admin group automatically contains the dfs-server
  principals of the machines that run DFS server processes.  Thsi group can be
  included in DFS admin lists to allow all members of the group to have the
  admin privileges associated with the list.  We may want to discuss or at
  least mention how and when the dfs-server principals are added to the
  dfs-admin group.

       In the application development guide, it would be useful to have

Many manpages do not currently include an EXAMPLES section.  All manpages
should include an examples section.  Some of this information was not and
still is not available.  We will try to nail this one sometime after 1.0.1.
The following manpages are currently without examples:
bak
	dumpinfo
	labeltape
	restoredb
bakserver
bos
	install
	lsadmin(1dfs)
	prune
	stop
	uninstall
bosserver 
butc 
cm
	checkfilesets
	lsstores
	resetstores

dfsexport
flserver
fts
	lsmount
	lsreplicas
	lsserverentry
	statftserver
	statrepserver
	syncfldb
newaggr
repserver
Thanks to IBM for listing and reporting the deficient manpages.

Full Description:

	CDS man page for cdsclerk, -e option with no arguments should be default.
	The syntax for cdsclerk (other cds commands, also) shows [-e\*] as
	an option. This is messy, both in code and documentation. Why not
	make -e with no arguments be equal to full list of error messages,
	then explain how to specify less than full list of error messages?

Proposed Solution:

	See above for clean fix to both code and documentation.

[05/02/92 public]

	The same bug was submitted againt cdsadv - [Martha DasSarma]
        It says:
	CDS cdsadv, -e option with no args could be default.
        The syntax for cdsadv (other cds commands, also) shows [-e\*] as
	an option. ... [same writing as above].

OT defect 2890 describes changing the way the status flag is set for a
read-only fileset.  When the defect is addressed to change the status
flag only when a replica actually exists at a site, not when a replication
site is initially created, the description of the setting of the flag will
need to be modified in the files 6_ftavail_dfs.gpsml and fts_addsite.8dfs.

I changed this from a defect to an enhancement because the related code
defect (2890) is being considered as an enhancement.  Because of the obvious
dependency between this defect and defect 2890, I cannot make this change
until the code is changed.  It would be just great if, when defect 2890 is
fixed, the "fixer" of that defect could change this one from an enhancement
back to a defect....

	When using the exception returning interface, the user has no way
	to determine what exceptions may be returned. Each man page should
	state the likely exceptions for the function just as it states the
	return values for the error return interface.
	Add possible exception return values to man pages?
