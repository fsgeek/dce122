Intensive research (i.e., some embarrassing questions from Ron
Sasala) has once more pointed up the fact that the ERRORS sections
in the Application Reference manpages ought not to remain as they
are. Their contents were effectively replaced by the contents of
the Problem Determination Guide in DCE 1.1, and thus most of these
sections have not been updated since DCE 1.0.3. So it seems that
all the manpages should now simply have an ERRORS section that
refers the reader to the Problem Determination Guide. I don't think
this is an awfully big task, and I am willing to do it on a free
day or two, provided that (a) it's agreed that what I've suggested
should be done, and (b) that I ought to do it.

[8/8/96 public]

Hi, Doug,
I think it would be more appropriate to indicate in each manpage
that the set there is a representative sample and then point to the 
PDG for the exhaustive list of errors that could be returned. Doing
this would give a person a set of "common" errors that could be
checked for, while indicating that others might be present. What
I had in mind by that was it would permit calls to a function to
also check for a set of "what could have happened" errors and a
default. I will forward a note from Walt Tuvell that gives an
excellent example of this.

[8/9/96 public]

I am inserting here a portion of the referenced note from Walt
after discussing this with Willie, so all readers will have
the information at their disposal to facilitate decision-making.
Here it is (thanks, Walt!):

The idea of listing the per-page characteristic error codes is
to give guidance to implementors and to programmers.  Namely it
is good practice for programmers to be able to treat errors
locally (i.e., immediately as they occur in the program, because
that's where you have the most control over the runtime
environment -- that's also the theory with exceptions), thusly:

	func(a,b,c,&st);
	switch (st) {
	    case NOMEM: whatever(); break;
	    case SEGFAULT: whateverelse(); break;
	    default: perror("?!"); abort();
	}

Knowing that only a small number of errors are characteristic of
a given function gives the programmer a good chance to handle
most common situations, thereby writing robust programs.  To
give the programmer NO help at all, just saying that any of
hundreds of errors can occur in any function call, is not the
right thing to do.  The only way to handle that would be to
write an general-purpose error-handling routine that all error
conditions would dispatch to, but such a routine would not
understand all individual (locality-based) situations, contrary
to the above-stated good programming practice.  Such a
general-purpose error-handler can work in some limited
situations (such as interrupt-handles at the lowest levels of
kernels and device drivers), but is not to be promoted as the
best overall solution.

However, we MUST have an escape hatch, saying that "additional
error codes are allowable, for future purposes or for individual
implementations, etc."  The programmer can only handle those via
the switch's default leg, thus leading to less-robust programs.
We want to minimize the size of that default leg, within the
bounds of reasonability.
------------
-Ron

[8/14/96 public]
Even though the Errors sections of the manpages 
seem to be a magnet for errors (missing messages, 
wrong messages, confusing explanations, etc.), 
Walt's suggestion that errors produced by  
routines should be listed in the manpages as a guide 
for programmers seems like a good one.  

However to reduce the possiblity of errors, 
we should consider keeping the messages, 
but deleting the message explanantions and 
instead refer the reader to the Problem Determination Guide.   
Especially since there is no guarantee that I 
know of that the Errors sections of the manpages 
give the same explanation as the one in the Prob. Determination Guide.

[8/16/96 public]
Hmm, the notes sent on this subject of late indicate a straying from
my original suggestion which was a compromise made in the interests of:
 1. giving people the idea that the list in the manpage was
    not definitive, but rather, representative of some typical
    errors that might occur.
 2. giving an indication of the source for more definitive
    information.
 3. minimizing the work needed to alter the present situation
    where a person might not know the list was not definitive
    without unduly taxing the time Doug Weir had volunteered
    for the task in order to improve the omission of (1) while
    preventing the removal of any mention of specific errors
    at all in the manpages, which, I believe, was Doug's original
    suggestion.
Keep in mind that the usage of the manpages in the DCE documentation
and the AES's differs somewhat. I don't believe that there are online
versions for AES's. Our suggestion was to have a master list
of errors in the Security AES (which was the specification under
discussion at the time), to avoid duplication which leads to
errors and confusion if they are not kept in sync. (The new DFS AES
already has such a master list, and continuing on the present course
for the Security one would give us two specs using this technique.)

Then, Doug opened this CR to close a hole in the DCE documentation.
He used the idea that the PDG was akin to the master list in the
Security AES, complete with explanations, which the AES manpages will
"point to", then simply listing in the manpages the typical/common
errors that could occur. This compromise did not address anything
beyond closing the hole.

I still think we should go ahead with this CR as recommended.
Perhaps another one should be opened to solve (or at least
capture) the suggestion of the master list being either online
or being able to electronically retrieve desired information
from the list, whatever form it takes. One caveat: perhaps the
error explanations in the manpages should be removed when the
ability to retrieve or get at them electronically is provided.

[4/29/96 public]
Doug,
Could you also use this OT to correct the man pages for dce_aud_prev() and 
dce_aud_rewind() and add the man page for dce_aud_reset() in DCE1.2.2.
I placed three files in AFS cell, /afs/dce.osf.org/project/dce/ibm/audit/doc,
newapi.ps (postscript), newapi.mif (frame), and newapi.text for your 
references.

Since dce_aud_next() and dce_aud_prev() are almost the same, please correct
dce_aud_next() too for whatever I changed in dce_aud_prev().
Thanks.

[5/29/96 public]

Reassigned to IBM on Willie's advice.

[5/30/96 public]

Made and submitted corrections to dce_aud_prev.3sec and dce_aud_rewind.3sec,
and created the new dce_aud_reset.3sec manpage.

[5/30/96 public]

Made and submitted the corrections to dce_aud_next.3sec.

[7/22/96 public]
Further investigation, I discovered that dce_aud_modify_sstrategy() and
dce_aud_set_local_cell_uuid() are not external APIs.  They were added
in Security API and DCECP for their internal purposes.  

Since dce_aud_next(), dce_aud_prev(), dce_aud_rewind(), and dce_aud_reset()
are done.  I am closing this OT.

The registry attributes that describe lifetimes (e.g., deftktlife,
maxtktlife, etc) use the term "hours" to denote the type of value
expected.  Using the term "hours" leads readers to believe that they
can use an integer value (despite the clarification in the attribute
description).  However, if you specify an integer rather than the DTS
relative time format, the time is interpreted in seconds, not hours.
For example:
EX: dcecp> registry modify -maxtktlife 96 -deftktlife 96
rgy_edit=> prop
  Properties:
    Properties for Registry at:               /.../support.dce.transarc.com

    Minimum certificate lifetime              1m
    Default certificate lifetime              1m36s  <----<<
This should be clarified to reduce misconceptions about how the values
are interpreted.

[2/20/96 public]

Two things.  First, shame on you for putting a 'rgy_edit' example in
a dcecp bug :-)

Second, this was taken care of in the HP manpage code drop for 1.2.
All 'time' related attributes are no longer specified as 'hours',
but rather 'relative_time', talking about DTS relative time format,
including the syntax.  As of 1.2, there is no confusion with these
attributes.

We need to restore the sec_salvage_db.8sec manpage to the Command
Reference. The un-updated 1.0.3 text of the manpage, as it was
reprinted as Appendix A of the 1.1 Release Notes, exists; the
problem is un-defuncting the manpage in the Command Reference,
which I'm unable to do. I think this requires the intervention
of a Rat. In the meantime, I've emailed the text to HP, where it's
being reviewed.

[2/21/96 public]

The manpage has been successfully undefuncted (thanks to Marty
Lynch). I'm reassigning this bug to Pam Millette now, because
I think she wants to make some changes in it for DCE 1.2.1.

[3/20/96 public]

Fixed. There are no updates to the original manpage, so the
undefuncted version remains as it was (in command_ref/man8sec).

[3/29/96 public]

Closed.

I have noticed that the ref. page for dce_aud_rewind() is missing.
It should be included in the next release. I will supply it.

[11/9/95 public]
The ref. page (ascii format) for dce_aud_rewind() is added to 
/afs/dce.osf.org/project/dce/ibm/audit.  Please add the SML tags
to include it in DCE1.2.1 timeframe.

[12/12/95 public]
Corrected the component and CR to Doc.

[3/15/96 public]
Fixed. The dce_aud_rewind.3sec manpage has been added to the Appli-
cation Reference.

[10/18/95 public]

Bob Binstock's Prentice Hall command reference edit for Prentice Hall
uncovered several references to a group_override(5sec) manpage.  However,
no such page exists.  The group override function is supported in R1.1 and
there should be a corresponding manpage to describe the file structure. All
of the necessary information for such a manpage is included in the Admin
Guide Core in section 36.2.3.

[Hasbrouck 10/18/95 public]

Sorry about this.  Digital was to have submitted this man page when
the group override code went in.  Fell through the cracks.  Judy Egan,
our doc supervisor, is in class this week.  Should be able to drop in
the doc source some time next week.

.TH group_override "5sec" "" "" ""
.iX "group_override command"
.iX "commands " "group_override"
.SH "NAME"
\*Lgroup_override\*O - The registry group override file.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sS
\*Vdcelocal\*L/etc/group_override\*O
.sE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \*Vdcelocal\*L/etc/group_override\*O administrative file lets you
override the
group UNIX ID and member list for a group similar to the manner in which
the passwd_override
file
permits overriding information in the network registry database. The
override takes effect when you run passwd_export. It may also impact
local
security mechanisms of vendor specific implementations.
.sp
The \*Lgroup_override\*O file is stored on each machine. Any changes you
make
to it
are in effect for the local machine only, and have no effect on the
centralized
registry. You may find \*Lgroup_override\*O especially useful
for overriding the
default
group definitions supplied with the registry if they do not match your
local
UNIX system.
.SS "The group_override File Format"
The format of the \*Lgroup_override\*O entries is similar to entries in the
UNIX
group file. The format is as follows:
.sS
\*Vgroup_name\*L:\*Vpasswd\*L:\*Vgroup_uid\*L:\*Vmembers\*O
.sE
.sp
In the override entry, \*Vgroup_name\*O and \*Vgroup_uid\*O are
keyfields.
You must enter one to
identify the group to which the override applies. The keyfield is used
to
perform a lookup in the override file. The lookup is performed in order
as the
fields are specified in an override entry: first by group name,
then by group
UNIX ID. If you specify both keyfields in an override entry, the
\*Vgroup_name\*O is
used as the lookup key; subsequent fields are
used as overrides.
.SS "Field Descriptions"
.sp
Each of the entries in the \*Vgroup_override\*O file is described below.
.sp
.VL
.LI "\*Vgroup_name\*O"
A keyfield that contains the name that identifies the group to which the
override applies.
.LI "\*Vpasswd\*O"
This field specifies the encrypted password. If you specify an override
in this field, the password you enter is in effect for this local
machine only.
.sp
You can also specify \*LOMIT\*O in the \*Vpasswd\*O field to disallow
\*Lnewgrp's\*O to this group on the local machine. The use of \*LOMIT\*O
in conjunction with an option to the \*Lpasswd_export\*O command also
prevents the inclusion of this group in the group file created by
\*Lpasswd_export\*O. (See the section entitled "Using OMIT," later in
this command reference, for details.)
.LI "\*Vgroup_uid\*O"
A group UNIX ID. This field can function as a keyfield, when no other
keyfields are entered, or as a field containing an override, when
entered in conjunction with \*Vgroup_name\*O. This field specifies the
local
override of the group ID supplied by the network registry server.
.LI "\*Vmembers\*O"
This field specifies a comma-separated list of members of the group. The
contents of this field will override information in the registry when
\*Lpasswd_export\*O creates an \*L/etc/group\*O file. Note that to specify
a
null membership, as opposed to indicating no override is required, use
an asterisk (*) for this field.
.LE
.SS "Leaving Fields Blank"
.sp
If you do not want to override an item, leave its field blank,
separating each blank field with a colon (:). Note that to override a
group with a null membership list, enter an asterisk (*) for
the \*Vmembers\*O field.
.SS "Using OMIT"
.sp
If you enter either the word \*LOMIT\*O or another invalid password string
(such
as an asterisk or \*LNO GOOD\*O) in the \*Vpasswd\*O field, users will not
be
able to issue a \*Lnewgrp\*O to this group on the local machine. If you
specify \*LOMIT\*O and run \*Lpasswd_export\*O with the \*L-x\*O option,
the named group will not appear in the \*L/etc/group\*O file produced by
\*Lpasswd_export\*O.
.sp
You should also be aware that, if you have omitted groups from the
\*L/etc/group\*O file, information about those groups will not be available
to
any programs that use the group file. For example, the \*Lls -lg\*O command
accesses the group file to obtain further information about a group. If
the group is omitted, no group entry will exist and no information will
be available. For this reason you should use \*LOMIT\*O to omit groups from
the \*L/etc/group\*O file only if your user community is very large and
either
of the following conditions occur:
.ML
.LI
The \*Lgroup\*O file is taking up too much space.
.LI
Group-ID-to-name mapping is too slow (during \*Lls -lg\*O, for example).
.LE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.AL
.LI
To override the group ID of group kmem to be 3, the entry in the
\*Lgroup_override\*O file is as follows:
.sp
.oS
kmem::3:
.oE
.sp
.LI
To override the membership for group system to
be the single account root, the entry is as follows:
.sp
.oS
system:::root
.oE
.sp
.LE
.SH "RELATED INFORMATION"
.sp
Command:
\*Lpasswd_export(8sec)\*O

[11/15/95 public]

A modified version of the above page has been added to the OSF DCE
Command Reference.  The passwd_override(5sec), sec_intro(5sec), and 
passwd_export(8sec) ref pages have also been modified to reflect its inclusion.

DCE_SVC_LOG only works with BINFILE output form. A quick look at the code
reveals why (from dce_svc_bin_log in svcprintf.c the function bound to the
DCE_SVC_LOG macro):

	default:
	    dce_assert(handle, "Unknown debug route created" == NULL);
	    /* FALLTHROUGH */
	case route_stdout:
	case route_stderr:
	case route_textfile:
	case route_discard:
	case route_default:
	case route_goesto:
	    break;
	case route_binfile:
	    dce_svc__binprint(r->data.binfile.fd, &prolog, args);
	    break;
	}


This should probably be something like:

	switch (r->route) {
	default:
	    dce_assert(handle, "Unknown debug route created" == NULL);
	    /* FALLTHROUGH */
	case route_discard:
	case route_default:
	    break;
	case route_binfile:
	    dce_svc__binprint(r->data.binfile.fd, &prolog, args);
	    break;
	case route_stdout:
	    dce_svc__vfprintf(stdout, &prolog, TRUE, args);
	    break;
	case route_stderr:
	    dce_svc__vfprintf(stderr, &prolog, TRUE, args);
	    break;
	case route_textfile:
	    dce_svc__vfprintf(r->data.textfile.f, &prolog, FALSE, args);
	    break;
	case route_goesto:
	    rp = dce_svc__goesto(r->data.goesto.where, &goesto);
	    break;
	}
 
from dce_svc__debug also in svcprintf.c.

[08/21/95 public]
No, it works *exactly* as advertised; from the manpage:
>  DCE_SVC_LOG generates a record in the serviceability binary format,
>  not a conventional serviceability message as such. The complete

[08/21/95 public]

Yes, but this is the only place where that is mentioned:

DCE_SVC_INTRO:

	DCE_SVC_LOG() generates debugging output based on a message
		      defined in an application's sams file

Then, there is the following plain wrong statement in the Dev. Guide (p.
4.34):

	The following call ... would have written this message to
	standard error (because that is the routing specified in
	the sams file), ...

		DCE_SVC_LOG((HEL_S_DEBUG_MESSAGE_1_MSG));

I'm changing this to a doc bug. It's still A1 though. 

BTW why this restriction?

[08/21/95 public]
Okay, it's a doc bug.  DCE_SVC_LOG was added specifically for GDS, which
needed to dump large binary data, but wanted to compile-out the calls.

[1/15/96 public]

Filled in sub-component field. Assigned to myself, as I created the
original document(s).

[3/11/96 public]

Fixed, I believe. I emended the offending passage in the Application
Guide chapter to read as follows:

 The debug serviceability messaging routines are the following:

 DCE_SVC_LOG()

 ---------def,13047,R1.2.1,clarify DCE_SVC_LOG behavior"------------

 Outputs a message specified by the message ID. The main differences
 between using this routine and using dce_svc_printf() to write a message
 are (1) that DCE_SVC_LOG() generates records only in binary format,
 and (2) the macro can be compiled out of the executable by turning off
 debugging.
 ---------def,13047,R1.2.1,clarify DCE_SVC_LOG behavior-------------


However, the DCE_SVC_LOG.3dce manpage plainly states the correct
behavior (in some detail), and it always has. I don't know why this
was missed by the original complainant, but the text seems pretty
clear to me.

[3/29/96 public]

Closed.

 The acl_edit(1sec) man page is missing part of a sentence in the DESCRIPTION
 section. The man page currently reads:
 DESCRIPTION
 [...]

      ACL on the object to which the directory entry refers - then
      you simply omit the -e option. [...]

 It should read (according to the Prentice Hall version):

                                                   If, on the other
      hand, you want to access the ACL on the object to which the
      directory entry refers - then you simply omit the -e option. [...]

[9/14/95 public]

I'm assigning this to myself, but Bob Binstock (here at OSF)
and I had a conversation yesterday in which he agreed to make
the change.

[9/19/95]

And he is good to his word.  Correction made as above.

Subject: NDR question
Mike,
        I'm a member of Transarc's DCE maintenance group.  One of our
customers has run across an incompatibility between the 1.0.2 and
1.0.3 IDL compilers, and I need an informed opinion on the NDR wire
encoding.  Craig Everhart thought you might either be able to answer
my question, or redirect me to someone who can.
Here's the gist: the customer has defined a tagged union which covers
different sized data items, using an enumerated type as the
discriminator.  He's encapsulated this union in a structure.

        case E_LONG:   long  int  long_t;
        case E_FLOAT:  float      float_t;
        case E_DOUBLE: double     double_t;
        case E_ARRAY:  [ptr] struct SSS *array_t;
        case E_STRING: [ptr,string] char *string_t;
        default: ;
    } data;
} SSS;
void glop([in]handle_t h, [ptr,in] SSS *arg, [out] long int *st);
}
------------------------
Here's the problem.  Imagine we call glop, passing an SSS of type
E_STRING.  The 1.0.2 stub transmits the following byte stream:
    00 00 00 01 00 06 XX XX 00 00 00 02 ....
where XX are fill bytes, 00 00 00 01 identifies the structure's node,
00 06 is the type field, 00 00 00 02 identifies the string's node, and
the .... is the encoding of the string.
The 1.0.3 stub sends:
    00 00 00 01 XX XX XX XX 00 06 XX XX 00 00 00 02 ....
ie: the 1.0.3 stub appears to be aligning the union to 8 bytes.  And
sure enough, in the marshalling table emitted by the 1.0.3 compiler,
there is an IDL_NDR_ALIGN_8 just before the IDL_DT_ENC_UNION
directive.  Presumably, the new idl compiler decided to align the
union to the largest possible member.  As a check, I changed the
IDL_NDR_ALIGN_8 to a IDL_NDR_ALIGN_2 (which acts as a noop in this
particular case), and the 1.0.3 stub started inter-operating with the
1.0.2 stub.
My reading of chapter 14 of the AES ("Transfer Syntax NDR") makes me
think we're only supposed to align primitive items.  I think the 1.0.2
compiler did the right thing, and the 1.0.3 compiler is broken.  But I
need an informed opinion.  Which encoding is right?  And the harder
question, if the 1.0.3 compiler is broken, what do we do about all the
broken compilers out there?
Thanks for any help you can give me!

Sorry, I don't have anything to do with RPC or IDL.  I just happened to
be sent the above mail on the topic from Transarc.  Unassigning this from
myself so someone in the RPC/IDL support area will reassign it.

[3/2/95 public]
People would expect the AES to specify what kind of alignment should happen
in this case. Unfortunately, the published 1.0.3 AES RPC only says something
for primitive types (Section 14.2.2).

I checked the latest AES source and found the following extra about
alignment (sorry, but I am not going to format it):

--- start to quote ---
.H 3 "Alignment of Constructed Types"
.iX "NDR constructed types" "alignment"
.P
The octet-stream representation of an NDR constructed type is a
sequence of representations of NDR primitive types. For most
constructed types, each primitive in the representation of the
constructed type is NDR-aligned according to the description in
Subsection 14.1.2.  However, for structures, NDR defines more than one
alignment.
.P
Alignment gaps can appear in the octet stream before and/or within
the sequence of primitives that represents a constructed type.
.H 4 "Alignment of Structures"
.iX "NDR constructed types" "structure alignment"
.P
NDR defines aligned and unaligned structures. The representations
of an aligned structure and an unaligned structure differ only in
the alignment required for the first primitive in the representation
of the structure.
.P
The first primitive in an aligned structure is represented in the NDR
octet stream at an alignment equal to the greatest of the alignments
that would apply to the members of the structure. That is, if the
largest element has size \*Vn\*O, then the first scalar is aligned at
an octet stream index that is a multiple of \*Vn\*O.  The first
primitive in an unaligned structure is represented in the NDR octet
stream at the alignment that would apply to the first member of the
structure.
.P
The same alignment rules apply to nested constructed types.  Thus if a
structure contains a substructure, the alignment of the first
primitive in the substructure likewise has the greatest alignment
value of all of the elements of the substructure.

--- end of quote ---

From the above description, it appears that 1.0.2 IDL treats union as an
unaliagned structure, while 1.0.3 IDL treats union as an aligned structure.
But the section for Union still does not say what a union should be treated.

Too bad that we broke compatibility, but really there is no right or wrong
between 1.0.2 idl and 1.0.3/1.1 idl. All we need is one consistent encoding
and one clear doc which says what things should happen.

What to do with this incompatibility? Upgrade to 1.0.3 or 1.1 idl. It does not
make sense tome that we chamge back to the 1.0.2 idl behavior. We will
make this an aes defect. The easiest fix is to add to aes that a union should
be treated as an aligned structure. And a note to document this incompatibility
between earlier (pre 1.0.3) idl and later idl.

[3/21/95 public]
Arthur Harvey informed me that the text I quoted above is actually not quite
right and was removed from the AES (I did not noticed the cS and cE macro
around them for suppression).

OSF is aware of this incompatibility problem and is working with the IDL
folks at DEC to find out what needs to be fixed in the AES regarding NDR
alignment rules. There is a bunch of information about alignment of 
structures which is missing from the NDR chapter. Last I heard, the plan is 
to specify the 1.0.3+ behavior.

[3/20/96 public]
Marked as an AES bug, and assigned to Art Harvey.

[4/4/96 public]
Reassigned (on Art's monition) to Susan Thompson.

[11/25/96 public]

Chapter 14 (NDR) of the CAE Specification has been updated at 1.1 with
NDR alignment rules as per X/Open Corrigenda U010.  No plans at this
time for updates to the AES.

 The cdscp_clear_cached_server.8 man page ARGUMENTS section has the "name"
 argument indented into the explanation.

  The same problem is true for the arguments to cdscp_clear_clearinghouse(8cds)
 man page.

 The attribute-value summary in the arguments section of cdscp's
add_directory  man page is not formatted properly, the indent is not right.

[7/5/95 public]

Assigned this to Digital for DCE 1.2, though perhaps
the right thing to do is simply cancel the bug, since
the command program manpages are obsolescent now.

[9/19/95 public]

Well, I needed to fix them for 1.1PH, so I did.  Corrected as above.
One less burden for the designated DEC individual, whomever she may be ...

In the Application Development Reference, and in the help topics
DCE RPC_Application_routines rpc_sm_get_thread_handle and
DCE RPC_Application_routines rpc_sm_set_thread_handle:

The rpc_sm_get_thread_handle() routine documents its return value as a
rpc_sm_thread_handle_t which is a type that doesn't exist.  It should
probably be rpc_ss_thread_handle_t.  The documentation of the routine
rpc_sm_thread_handle_t() has the same problem.

This same problem exists in both the online help and in the online
documentation.

[3/11/96 public]

Ward Rosenberry just brought this CR to my attention; its eccentric
subcomponent field value enabled it to evade capture for years, ap-
parently. What's said above seems convincing, but I want to wait 24
hours before just making the change out of hand.

weir 3/12/96 public]

Fixed. I checked the source code in:

  /project/dce/build/dce1.2/src/rpc/idl/lib/eenodtbl.c

--which confirms that the return type of rpc_sm_get_thread_handle()
should be rpc_ss_thread_handle_t, and the first parameter to
rpc_set_thread_handle() should be the same (in both cases vice
rpc_sm_thread_handle_t). I have made these changes in the manpages.

We have made the following change requests for the Directory Sevices to
X/Open.  Changes OSF-1 through OSF-5 apply to both the OSF version of the
AES and the X/Open version, and are being made to the create Revision B of
this document.  Change numbers OSF-6 and OSF-7 apply to front matter of the
X/Open version of the AES that does not have any equivalent in the OSF
version of the AES, and will therefore not be made to the OSF AES.

The scout documentation currently states that only a full DCE pathname of a
File Server machine can be specified with the -server option of the command.
However, the option also accepts the hostname (which can be abbreviated) or
the IP address of the machine.  The specification you employ also impacts
your use of the command's -basename option.  The following files are affected:
 
./src/dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/gd/scout.gpsml
./src/dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/ref/man8dfs/scout.8dfs
 
This is a relatively simple fix that I can incorporate well before the freeze
for 1.1.
 
Added field Transarc Deltas with value `'

Added field Transarc Status with value `'

[10/11/94 public]
I corrected the desriptions of the -server and -basename options in the scout

Update the DCE RPC AES to ensure that it conforms to the version published
by the X/Open Company.  We will increase the revision to B, and will not
this in the Preface.  The technical changes are listed in the following mail message from Arthur Harvey



To: hal
cc: annie, harvey
Subject: Changes to RPC AES
Date: Sun, 25 Sep 94 15:34:18 -0400
From: "Arthur Harvey, (617) 621-8875" <harvey>

Hal,

Here are all the changes for the RPC AES.  I am using the version of
the AES shipped with DCE 1.0.2.  If the page numbers don't match your
doc, I'll lend you my copy.

-Arthur
		--------------------------------------

Change: Page 13-11, section 13.2.6.2.2, delete line
		u_int8	reserved;

 Data structure should be 
	typedef struct {
			u_int8	sub_type;
			} auth_value_t;

		--------------------------------------

Change: Page 4-38, sect. 4.3.5.3.  Add a new paragraph after the first
paragraph :

   The environment variable RPC_DEFAULT_ENTRY must be set to the name
   of the namespace entry from which the stub will import bindings to
   be used when an operation is invoked.

		--------------------------------------

Change: Page 14-23, sect. 14.3.7.  Add a new paragraph at the bottom
of the page.

   For a non-encapsulated union, the discriminant is marshalled into
   the transmitted data stream twice: once as the field or parameter,
   which is referenced by the [switch_is] construct, in the procedure
   argument list; and, once as the first part of the union
   representation as shown in figure 14-26.

		--------------------------------------

Change: Page 4-24, section 4.2.19.2, 3rd sentence.  Replace 
   "extent is be determined" 
by
   "extent is determined".

		--------------------------------------

Change: Page 4-24, section 4.2.19.2.  Add a new paragraph to end of the
subsection.

   Also, a conformant array with the [string] attribute need not have
   a [max_is] or [size_is] attribute if it is contained in an object
   referenced by an [in, out] or [out] pointer.  In these cases, the
   extent is determined from the length of the data passed and may

   4.2.23'  Function Pointers

   The following sections describe the syntax, semantics and
   restrictions of function pointers.

   4.2.23.1' Syntax

   The syntax for declaration of a function pointer is:

   <function_ptr_declarator> ::= 
	<simple_type_spec> ( * <identifier> ) <param_declarations>

   4.2.23.2' Semantics

   An instance of a function pointer type allows functions to be
   referenced indirectly.

   4.2.23.3' Restrictions

   Function pointers are permitted only within interfaces declared
   with the [local] attribute.
   

		--------------------------------------

Change: Page 4-46, section 4.4.1, before item (80) add: 
   (79) <function_ptr_declarator> ::=

		--------------------------------------

Change: Page 6-7, table 6-1, in the table description for 'idempotent'
replace:
   "produces identical outcomes iwthout undesirable side effects."
by
    "does not produce undesirable side effects."

		--------------------------------------

Change: Sectio 6.3, page 6-22, delete the last bullet item
    "wrong_boot_time" 
from this list.

		--------------------------------------

Change: Section 12.5.1, page 508, 3rd paragraph:

    These two sentences (beginning with "In practice, however, ...", should 
    be replaced with:

    "The AES/DC defines a lower bound on the size of a single PDU that all
    implementations must be able to receive, MustRecvFragSize.  A client and
    server may subsequently negotiate a larger PDU size during the course of 
    their conversation.  This negotiation may take place explicitly (by 
    conveying the value in the body of a fack PDU; see section 12.5.3.4),
    or implicitly (by presuming that a peer can receive packets as large 
    as those it has transmitted)."

		--------------------------------------

Change: Section 12.5.2.9, page 12-9, at the end of the section add:
    "The protocol also allows for PDUs to be transmitted by the endpoint 
    mapper on behalf of a server process; for example, the endpoint
    mapper may return a reject PDU upon receipt of a request sent to a server
    that is not currently running.  In such cases, any PDUs transmitted by the 
    endpoint mapper must carry a 0 boot time, to disambiguate them from 
    PDUs that might subsequently be received by the target server."

		--------------------------------------

Change: Section 12.5.3.4, page 12-14, in the typedef:
Replace
     "max_path_tpdu" 
by
     "max_frag_size"

		--------------------------------------

Change: Section 12.5.3.4, page 12-15, line 16049-16051, replace the
second bullet beginning with 
   "An NDR unsigned long integer ..."
by
    "An NDR unsigned long integer indicating the fack-sender's suggested
    maximum PDU size for this conversation.  The actual PDU size used may be 
    further limited by the fack-receiver."


		--------------------------------------

Change: Appendix K, Table K-1:
    TIMEOUT_ACK    should be 1 second
    TIMEOUT_FRAG   should be 2 seconds
    TIMEOUT_PING   should be 2 seconds    
    TIMEOUT_RESEND should be 2 seconds
    TIMEOUT_WAIT   should be Infinity

Add a new table:

    ---------------------------------------------
    |  Reference Name    |  Protocol  |  Value  |
    ---------------------------------------------
    | MustRecvFragSize   |     CO     |  1432   |
    ---------------------------------------------
    | MustRecvFragSize   |     CL     |  1464   |
    ---------------------------------------------

		--------------------------------------

Change: Page 11-61.  Replace Figure 11-4 with the following PostScript:
ld be 2 seconds

(interminable PostScript figure omitted for brevity sake.)

[10/24/94 public]

All fixed by me.  Additional work was done to make the figures print
properly (on the next page, in a reasonable part of the page, etc, and to
make the frontmatter pagination correct.  I'm not sure if Arthur has
finished verifying this.  I will check.

The following changes were to the time AES were requested by Art Harvey to
make the OSF AES fully conformant to the AES as printed by X/Open.  As a
result, we are increasing the Revision to B, and the Preface must also be
changed to indicate this fact.

Change:  In section 6.3.2 ServerRequestGlobalTime, the functional
description states that "The global server also returns its epoch
number and an indication of its courier role". There is no parameter
defined for courier role.

 Reword the last sentence of the functional description to read: "The
global server also returns its epoch number."

In the DCE Audit Service Adminsitrative Tasks section
page 43-3 it says a DCE security group can be created which
consists of the servers on the host that are authorized
to generate audit records by doing the following steps,
however when I try these steps I am getting errors:

root@clam> acl_edit /.:/hosts/clam/audit-server
sec_acl_edit> m group:group/hosts/clam/audit-clients:l
ERROR: SEC_ACL_EDIT - invalid or unknown entry key (dce / sad)
sec_acl_edit> m group:group/hosts/clam/audit-admin:rwc
ERROR: SEC_ACL_EDIT - invalid or unknown entry key (dce / sad)
sec_acl_edit> 


sec_acl_edit> l

# SEC_ACL for /.:/hosts/clam/audit-server:
# Default cell = /.../clam_cell.qadce.osf.org
unauthenticated:-r--
user:hosts/clam/self:crwl
group:subsys/dce/audit-admin:crwl
any_other:-r--

[10/6/94 public]

This is a doc bug, page 43-3 is incorrect

The initial ACL should be listed as follows:

# SEC_ACL for /.:/hosts/clam/audit-server:
# Default cell = /.../clam_cell.qadce.osf.org
unauthenticated:-r--
user:hosts/clam/self:crwl
group:subsys/dce/audit-admin:crwl
any_other:-r--


Then before giving permissions to audit-clients
"audit-clients" needs to be created by rgy_edit:

Then the user can type:

sec_acl_edit> m group:audit-clients:l

Then to grant permissions to administrators the correct command is:

sec_acl_edit> m group:subsys/dce/audit-admin:rwc

There is a second problem with the documentation: it uses acl_edit rather
than dcecp.  This appears to be the only use that I can find (in a brief
scan of the audit chapters of the admin guide) where dcecp is not used.
Therefore, this CR should also cover converting the (corrected) information
to use dcecp.

We've found that the locking done with dce_db_lock() [and unlock] should
only be advisory.  This affects the dce_db_lock/dce_db_unlock manpages
and perhaps related app gd doc.  I guess the users can think of these as
they do unix's flock(3). (perhaps mention this in the manpage)

It's "advisory" in that it does not prevent someone (another thread)
from writing to a locked backing store.  To use it, if you app wants
exclusive access, the places in the code writes/deletes would surround
their writes/deletes with lock/unlock.

[10/04/94 public]
Fixed ./dce_books/app_ref/man3dce/dce_db_lock.3dce to show locks as
advisory.  In ./dce_books/app_ref/man3dce/dce_db_iter_start.3dce, changed
the advice.  User must -always- lock during iteration to get the benefit.

The man5sec audit_intro page is currently a placeholder with little real
inforamtion.  Since man5sec has few pages, it makes more sense to put a
full list of all pages in sec_intro.5sec and defunct audit_intro.  At the
same time, the Description file should be updated to format all man5sec
pages.  I'm assigning this to myself.

The DCE Cell Namespace appendix in the Admin Guide Intro contains
tables that describe the various namespace entries for CDS,
Security, and for 1.1, dced.  These table entries use the
terms "Initial Configuration ACL" throughout to introduce 
default ACLs, and use other confusing terms like
"Default Container ACL". 

At the suggestion of Howard Melman and Rajendra Desai, I will
improve/standardize the use of ACL terminology to refer only
to "Default ACLs", "Object ACLs", "Initial Container ACLs",
and "Initial Object ACLs".

[09/06/94 public]
Fixed and verified.

Closed bug.

[10/20/94 public]
Also used this CR to incorporate a final technical review
of this namespace appendix.  The following changes were made:

1) Default cell = /.../cellname line removed throughout

2) Created By line removed throughout

3) Security Type line removed throughout

4) All mentions of the ACL editor were removed

5) Various changes made to wording of table entry descriptions

Opening doc CR to match 11049, assigning it to myself.

Several backing store functions now return an error if called during
iteration. 

Doc should reflect this. Status code db_s_iter_not_allowed can be
returned by dce_db_store*, dce_db_delete*, dce_db_iter_start, dce_db_count.

[9/8/94 public]

Fixed these files by adding db_s_iter_not_allowed error:

-------------------------

Please note: if we decomment

        /*
        x500_attrs[0].attr_value.tagged_union.printstring = era_buf ;
        */

the sample program works. ( era_buf is defined as:

unsigned char era_buf[] = "";

........)

Our gds_sec tests also run if we set

x500_attrs[0].attr_value.tagged_union.printstring = era_buf ;

(and define "unsigned char era_buf[2048]")

what doesn't make any sense for us.
We use this as a temporary work around - but the reported problem 
should be fixed.

This is an IDL limitation.  If you want to pass data over the wire and that
data's size is determined by a null terminating character or by a num_bytes
field, then that data must be initialized to something that IDL can marshall.
Even though the server side of sec_login_set_extended_attrs() ignores the
value of the attribute (IN MOST CASES; If it turns out to be a trigger ERA, it
may not ignore it), the data must be non-garbage if it's not a fixed size
attribute type (ie: integer) that IDL can handle without dereferencing that
data.  So, you must initialize the printstring to NULL, and if you were
passing in a bytes type ERA, you would have to initialize the num byte field
to 0.  I'm changing this to a DOC bug.  (btw, since you stated 2 workarounds
that you were able to use above, this shouldn't have been an A0 in the first
place).

[09/01/94 public]
Reopened. You are probably right that this a doc problem.
But - as far as I know - it's not documented yet. Because of that
we have had the problem - it took a long time to find the workaround.

It should be documented for all parts of the tagged_union
how to initialize the component (i.e.: how to initialize a print_array).

[9/1/94 public]
Sorry about that, my fingers were working faster than my brain this morning.
I meant to change it back from cancel to open before I exited after changing
it to a doc defect, but I exited the editor too quickly and snoopy stopped
responding for about 15minutes...  Thanks for reopening it.  You're correct
that it's not documented for this particular API yet.

[10/19/94 public]
Fixed and verified.  Verified bu burati.

[10/27/94 public]
Closed bug.

I made various changes to the DFS APIs for the FTSERVER* and VL* calls.  I
corrected some incorrect types and parameters, and I clarified some descriptive
text.  The bulk of the changes were made to bring the documentation a bit more
closely in line with the source code.
 
Added field Transarc Deltas with value `' 
Added field Transarc Herder with value `' 
Added field Transarc Status with value `open'

[8/29/94 public]
I made the updates to all necessary DFS API files.  The changes were suggested
by, discussed with, and reviewed by David VanRyzin (with a timely assist from
the top of the mount by The Burning Bush of development, Dr. E).  The following

This is not a bug but somewhere (release Notes?) it needs 
to be documented that the 1.0.3 dce_config option to unconfigure
a client fails if the client is running DCE 1.1

Here is the example output:

        Enter hostname of node to be unconfigured: (thread) needle


        Unconfiguring a node will remove the node's ability
        to operate in the cell.  A reconfiguration of the
        node will be required.

[8/26/94 public]
I just got these same messages when trying to unconfigure
my nodes from my 1.1 bl-16 cell.  So I don't think it's related
to 1.0.3/1.1 interoperability.

[8/26/94 public]

Corrected the description line and upgraded the priority since
we use this option a lot.

[8/26/94 public]
The latest (8/26) version of dce.unconfig correctly removes the
hosts/<hostname>/config entry, which is put there by dced.
This should prevent unconfig errors in 1.1.

You should always use 1.1 tools when dealing with a 1.1 machine.
No harm telling people that in the docs, which is why I lower the
priority and set this to be a doc bug.

The dtsdate man page examples section refers to the command as dtstime.

[8/23/94 public]

In addition, please change the doc to read that dtsdate now returns a 
status value of 2 if the query flag is asserted and the time on the 
remote machine is more than <seconds> different from the local host.

The man pages for dce_cf routines that take host names as input
erroneously say that you should use lowercase when specifying them.
Host names are actually case-sensitive. The man pages need to
be corrected to say that host names are case sensitive.

Assigned this CR to myself, since I own the dce_cf pages.

This email from Shyh-Wei should end up somewhere in our docs....

 From luan@almaden.ibm.com Fri Jul 29 20:49:28 1994
 Subject: Proposed default audit filters

Greetings!

Upon Robert's request, I am sending the following initial filters as
a proposed default set for audit_config use in dce_config.

(There is no "standard" as to what should be audited.  For example,
the Orange Book only specifies what events should be "auditable" but
not what events should be "audited" for a C2 system.  This is always
a trade-off between performance/storage requirements and security
needs.)

The following suggested default filters catch events attempting to
change the TCB state/data, events failing to query the TCB state/data
(somebody is trying to see what is not supposed to be seen (denial), or
there is something wrong within TCB (failure)), and failed/denied
authentication events.

After a cell stablizes, modification events will hopefully be much less
frequent than query events, and failed/denied query events will likely
be rare.  Storage and performance impacts would then be reduced.

The TCB includes secd, dtsd, and auditd.

dcecp lines: (hope I got the dcecp syntax right :-)

audf create world -at {\
{dce_sec_modify dce_sec_server \
dce_dts_time_provider dce_dts_sync dce_dts_mgt_modify \
dce_audit_filter_modify} \
success log}

audf create world -at {\
{dce_sec_modify dce_sec_server \
dce_dts_time_provider dce_dts_sync dce_dts_mgt_modify \
dce_audit_filter_modify} \
{failure denial} all}

audf create world -at { \
dce_sec_authent dce_sec_query \
dce_dts_mgt_query \
dce_audit_filter_query} \
{failure denial} all}

Hope this helps,

The chapter in the GDS Admin Guide that introduces the GDS
admin tools needs to be updated to provide an overview
of the new 1.1 GDS admin tools (e.g., gdscp, gdsfollowup, ...)
and when to use them vs. when to use the admin menus
and "old" GDS admin tools. I believe the sourc filename
for the affected chapter is overview.admintools.gpsml .

[10/17/94 public]
The first two pages of chapter 4 of the GDS Administration Guide were
updated to give a brief explanation of the available GDS administration
programs.

In the man page for sec_rgy_acct_replace_all, the set_passwd
parameter is documented as :

set_passwd
             The password reset flag.  If TRUE, the password key will be
             reset. This will require the user to change the account
             password on the next login attempt.

This is wrong. This flag simply means that the user's password should
be changed to what is contained in the parameter new_key.

This change also applies to sec_rgy_acct_user_replace.

auditd now runs as machine principle. (See 11431 for details as to why this
was done.)  When this was done, the "-i" identity option was removed.  This
needs to be reflected in the admin guide and in the ref pages.

Also, the audit-admin group was added to allow for easier management of the
auditd.  This needs to be reflected in the admin guide.

[08/16/94 public]
Reassigned to myself, since I am working on the rest of
the audit ref pages.

[09/15/94 public]
The -i option has been removed from the auditd.8sec reference
page in the Command Ref, and a mention of auditd running as
machine principal has been added.

I opened a new CR, #12210, to cover the documenting of the
new group audit-admin, since this enhancement may affect 
more than one Admin Guide Intro chapters and thus deserves 
its own CR.

(Willie, sorry if this bug shouldn't be assigned to you.  I haven't
filed a doc bug in a while and I just don't know who to assign
them to these days.)

The following example is used in the acl_edit man page:

% acl_edit /.../dresden.com/afs/walden/progress_chart -m user:mike:cwx

That pathname is misleading.  It should use the correct dfs junction
name:

% acl_edit /.../dresden.com/fs/walden/progress_chart -m user:mike:cwx

The following two points need to be added to the DFS ACL chapter:
 
1. If you rename a directory, you also need to have w permission on the

2. If the target object (the new name) already exists, the existing object
   is deleted.

The reference pages are actually in the man3dce section of the reference

this is documentation for the "The generic attr schema interface" defined
in src/dce/utils/attr/dce_attr_sch.idl (per the dup CR 11404).
(And While I was at it I upped the Priority/Severity to B1 as this is new
functionality that needed documentation.)

The dce_error_inq_text(3rpc) man page should not claim that you must set
the NLSPATH environment variable.

With serviceability, all component who return application level status
codes should have their messages built in to libdce.

You should mention that if the user sets their LANG variable and
has the correct message catalog files installed, they may get translated
messages.  In other words, the text string returned can be dependant 
on the current locale.

Also, this page should mention the dce_error_string_t typedef, which
you can use to declare a character array suitable for the <error_text>
argument.  See <dce/dce_error.h> for the declaration of this.

/.:/sec/xattrschema object as part of ERA work that is being added in 1.1,
the replist object was added in 1.0.3

[08/11/94 public]
Assigned to myself.

[08/23/94 public]
Changed priority to "1" and severity to "B".

[09/06/94 public]
Added table entries for both /.:/sec/replist and /.:/sec/xattrschema.
I still need to edit the figure that shows the top-level
security directory so that it includes these new objects.

These changes verified by Rajendra Desai and Howard Melman.

[09/13/94 public]
Closed bug.
Peter Neilson added the new objects to Figure A-4, the Top-Level
Security Directory.  I verified all changes in the build output.

Per plans for 1.1, create a DCE GDS Administration Guide and Reference from
the gds section of the DCE Admin Guide Extended Services volume and the
man8gds section of the DCE Command Reference.  When this is done, the 
DCE Administration Guide Extended Services Volume will be obsolete and will
be defuncted.

[8/24/94 public]

Completed by moving the man8gds and admin guide directory/gds files to
a new gds_admin_gdref book and doing related changes.  Built and checked

The API returns a no-current-context status code if the rgy_handle 
param is NULL and the caller has no login context.  It is felt
that this shouldn't happen and the call should succeed, returning
the parsed name.

Note that with an rgy_handle and no login context it does work.

[8/4/94 public]
Unfortunately, this behavior cannot be changed.  I talked with Joe about it
and it turns out that since the sec_rgy_default_handle (NULL handle) func-
tionality is hidden under the covers, there's no real correct way to get info
about whether the data can be trusted or not if it were possible that the handle
could be obtained unauthenticated.  Because of this, there's a limitation that
when passing sec_rgy_default_handle to any of the security APIs, you must have
a valid login context set for the process.  This most likely needs to be
documented more explicitly, so Joe has asked that I reassign this to 'doc'.

The correct thing for dcecp to do is obtain it
's own unauthenticated handle
using sec_rgy_site_bind(/.:, ...);

The manpages for sec_rgy_site_open_XXX (and sec_rgy_site_get) all have
A note that follows this formant
	NAME
		sec_rgy_site_open_query - binds to a registry query site
	Note: to bind to a registry query site, the use of the
	    sec_rgy_site_bind_query() call is recommended in place of this
	    call.

The Note should be moved to the end and written as this:
	This routine is deprecated; use sec_rgy_site_bind_query instead.
Or, perhaps even just stop documenting sec_rgy_site_open(&site_get).

The second problem is that sec_rgy_site_bind_XXX all take a
sec_rgy_bind_auth_info_t parameter.  This datatype should be described
in intro(3sec).  Those manpages instead refer you to rpc_binding_set_auth_info
which does not help.

[8/29/94 public]
Yikes!  sec_rgy_site_open() is not deprecated, but sec_rgy_site_open_query()
is.  The documentation for that call should be removed (I thought this was
already reported and taken care of elsewhere) and the Notes should all be
removed.

[8/31/94 public]
Pam & I discussed this with Joe P a few weeks back and agreed that:
No man pages would be removed.
Use of site_open* and site_bind_query would be discouraged.
AES will document only site_bind and site_bind_update.

We don't see anything confusing about the current note, though Pam
is going to move them to their proper place in the NOTES section.

[9/1/94 public]
Fixed and verified. Verified by rps.  
I added sec_rgy_bind_auth_info_t and sec_rgy_bind_auth_info_type_t to 
the intro page and moved the note to the end of the files in the Notes 
section.  Note text was unchanged.

This was formerly part of 11429 -

Having auditd already running (and no env var set), I first added a couple 
of auditing related filters for principal cell_admin:

# auditcp
auditcp> audfilter add
Enter
0 for principal
1 for foreign principal
2 for group
3 for foreign group
4 for cell
5 for cell overridable
6 for world

Tailing the /tmp/messages svc file we see:

1994-07-23-21:27:23.166-04:00I----- auditd ERROR aud esl 0x40139268 unable to inform

process /opt/dcelocal/var/audit/client/19851/update_binding_file about esl update

This doesn't look too good, but let's try killing auditd, set the DCEAUDITFILTER
env var on and restarting auditd.  Here's what I got when I did a rc.dce on the 
restart:

1994-07-23-21:31:51.834-04:00I----- auditd NOTICE_VERBOSE aud general 0x7aff2d60 s

ister daemon's ACL manager interface bindings

More not too goods as auditd died.  I tried a couple of different things, but the 
only way I could get auditd up and running was to go through dce_config, using
the configure option to bring up auditd.  Taking a look through the svc trace
below and again above, it appears that there is a defect in auditd being able to 
ascertain its authent identity when not using dce_config/config.  (Note that the 
config will query for the cell admin principal name and password, whereas rc.dce
does not.)  This (as indicated above) results in a failure when trying to
register auditd ACL manager bindings. 

1994-07-23-21:47:26.307-04:00I----- auditd NOTICE_VERBOSE aud general 0x7aff2d60 s

auditd now seems to be happy... let's try dumping out the filters that
I set earlier:

# auditcp
auditcp> audfilter show
Enter
0 for principal
1 for foreign principal
2 for group
3 for foreign group
4 for cell
5 for cell overridable

Audit Actions:

Audit Conditions:

Event Classes:

Everything looks good.  Now let's try doing something that will result
in an auditable event - (audfilter remove of principal cell_admin):

# date

This looks bad.  It can't even open the principal's esl file!  However, auditcp 
doesn't indicate any sort of error - one would assume that this command had
succeeded!!!!

Meanwhile, the central trail isn't even logging auditable events:

/net/engobe/opt/dcelocal/var/audit/adm --> ls -l
total 2

Busted!

[7/27/94 public]
In the first sentence you indicate that "(and no env var set)", i.e. 
DCEAUDITFILTERON is not set either.
What were you trying to achieve, when adding/removing filters, while
DCEAUDITFILTERON was not set?   If you intend to use filters, this 
environment variable has to be set.
(it might be an interesting test scenario for negative testing, but 
that's about it.)

[7/27/94 public]
Actualy I got confused, there are here 3 different scenarios.
The first one, about the auditd reporting error:
"unable to inform process /opt/dcelocal/var/audit/client/16091/update_binding_f
ile about esl update".
An administrative action, whenever a audit client crashes, is to remove
the "16091/update_binding_file"  directory/file combination.
These files, are used by the audit daemon, to find out its clients, and notify
them about any filter changes.  Whenever audit clients are coming down
gracefully, they clean up these files, among other things, but not in case
of crashes, obviously.
The number 16091 is the pid of the audit client process, so you can know
that if a directory is there with a number not matching any live process pid,
it should be removed.    
The second scenario, with the "cannot register daemon's ACL manager interface
bindings", there is a CR open already, CR 11243.
The third one, it was not specified whether DCEAUDITFILTERON was set or not.
Will look into it.

[7/27/94 public]
About the third scenario: the "cannot open esl file ...../esl-princ" is just
a warning, not an error, and without getting into internals, it could be
quite ok.  Try performing the auditcp audfilter show operation before giving up.
It might very well work...
About not seeing the audit trail grow, the reason is that the operating system
is buffering the data, before writing it to the physical device.
If you would take auditd down, using auditcp, not kill, the buffer would be 
flushed to disk on termination of the process.  Or, if producing enough 
audit records, the buffer would get flushed automaticaly every so often.
(size of buffer is system dependent).

[7/28/94 public]

I've been able to get auditd started with the DCEAUDITFILTERON environment
variable set.  I've been able to add and view filters for auditd events, BUT
I still don't see any data being logged to the central trail file for auditd.
Without seeing data there, I can't tell if filters are even working.  I even
shut the auditd down to see if that would force the event records to be flushed
to disk.  Still nothing.  

How do I tell if filters are working? My acceptance procedure dictated that I
would set a filter and verify that the audit trail contained the appropriate
data based on the filter. 

I still think there's a problem here, but I don't konw if it's that I'm not
doing everything I'm supposed to be doing (doc issue) or that auditd doesn't
work as I expected it to...

[7/28/94 public]

There are a few things to check here.  Did you start auditd with the "-a" option
(for self auditing)?  Did you make sure that DCEAUDITOFF is unset?  Did you create
the right filter to capture the event/subject/outcome for which you like
to see audit record(s)?  (The scenario you described at the beginning of this
OT should do it if you were using cell_admin to remove the filter.)  

If you wish to see if auditd is appending audit records to its central
trail, try the "-D" option when starting auditd. You will see the 
length and address of the pickled audit record that is being appended.  These
are generated by two printf's (probably among a few others that I was not able
to clean up before I left the project).  These really should be removed or

This is a doc bug if anything.  I'm going to dup it into 11810 - which is
logged against sec, but really applies to auditd and dtsd as well.

[9/12/94 public]
The following information is from Rico Cruz at IBM.  I am therefore
reopening this CR.
"11444 and 11810 are really two different CRs and not dupes.
11444 is a "give-us-an-example-of-how-to-use-the-auditcp" CR.
11810 is a CR on a default filter that they are planning to ship
and therefore should be documented in the pubs.
I will address each separately (Robert Weisz "owns" 11444)."

[10/18/94 public]
Added a new section in the Admin Guide on enabling audit filtering. 
This include info on the removal of the update binding file, the
DCEAUDITFILTERON env variable, and how the OS buffers the audit trail file.

The documentation conversion from SML -> SGML is currently run manually.
If the conversion step were run as an automatic cron job, any errors that
occur during conversion could be addressed earlier.  An SGML conversion
script should be run periodically to identify any problems with the
DCE1.1 documentation.  Here are Hal's comments:

    I would like to have the SGML conversion tool run nightly.  This should
    simply be a matter of getting a cron job on quill to do the following:

	cd /project/docsrc/SGML/tpt/fickle/Convert
	make DCE

    This does NOT have to be synchronized with the nightly doc build as it
    works directly from the sources.

[7/29/94 public]

Added a script to run the conversion on quill nightly (starting at 12:45am).
There seems to be a bug with the Ultrix make, so I ended up commenting out
a problematic line in the /project/docsrc/SGML/tpt/fickle/Convert/Makefile.
Also had to build/install an Ultrix version of fickle under
/project/tools/bin/mips.ULTRIX/fickle.  The nightly cron script runs as
"devsrc" and sends e-mail upon completion to "dce-doc-osf" and "ratdce."

The dtsd manual page should be updated to contain the following
information, which is new for DCE 1.1.

dtsd <args> [-d] [-w <serviceability string>] 

-d      debug mode. Command will run in the foreground. 
-w      <serviceability string>. See svc_route(5) for a description of the 
	appropriate format for this entry.


Running dtsd as a server 

dtsd [ -s [-k courier|noncourier] [ -g ] [ -o ]]

-s      run as a server. Default is noncourier, local server 
-g      run as a global server 
-k      <courier|noncourier>  run as either a courier, or as a non-courier.
-o      when enabling as a server, set the clocks immediately. Equivalent 
        to the dtscp "enable set clock true" or the dcecp command 
        "dts activate -abruptly"
 
Running dtsd as a clerk

dtsd -c 

dtsd can still be started in the old 1.0.x, with no command line arguments. 
(except for -d and -w). This will require that dcecp be used to start 
the server. 

Note that the dce_config program will automatically provide the appropriate 
arguments automatically depending on the choice of configuration options.

These command line arguments can also be provided as part of the fixed
configuration strings provided to dced, if dced is configured to
automatically start the dtsd.

Extracted from 10942:

	Our lawyers tell us that any FSF code must be in seperate
	directories from OSF copyrighted code.  This is so licensees who
	choose not to work with FSF code can easily identify it.

	Therefore, the gnu_* files will be moved to directory/gds/nds/FSF/
	and the makefile will be changed accordingly.

This has been done, but the existence of these files should be explicitly
called out in the Porting and Testing Guide (and, perhaps, the release
notes?)

The status code rpc_s_no_more_entries was obsoleted and it looks
like the status code rpc_s_no_more_bindings replaced it. Although
the reference pages have been corrected, the Application Development
Guide still contains some references to using rpc_s_no_more_entries.

I'm assigning this CR to myself. I'll fix the references as part
of my IDL work on the only chapter that seems to be affected
(dce_books/app_gd/rpc/acf.gpsml).

Below is lifted from CR 11306.  This info should be included in the App Gd
ACL documentation somewhere.  They are guidelines, but will make things
work better with dcecp.  Ask Howard of Julie for details and clarifications.

NEW GUIDELINES FOR ACL MANAGER NAMES:

We would like to enforce guidelines for all DCE ACL managers.  These are
not architectural and dcecp will accept any valid ACL manager names, but we
would like DCE-named ACL managers to be named consistently and in an easily
usable manner.  Since dcecp is what will make these names visible to a user,
we are using dcecp attribute naming conventions:

ACL manager names for all of DCE must be:

1) lowercase
2) no underscores
3) no spaces
4) 16 bytes (sizeof "sec_acl_printstring_len").
5) Choose names similiar to object command names supported in dcecp
   wherever possible.
   For example, the ACL manager name "principal" refers to the object that
   contains registry information about principals; /.:/sec/principal.
   Note that dcecp will allow abbreviations. For example, a user
   can specify "org" for the ACL manager name "organization".
6) Names must be unique within a component's ACL manager but not
   within DCE. 
   For example, "xattrschema" can be used for a DCED Extended
   Attribute Configuration Schema ACL object and for a Security 
   Extended Registry Attribute Schema ACL object.
7) The helpstring for an ACL manager must specify the component
   that owns or manages the objects in questions, since this 
   information cannot always be derived from the ACL manager name.

The Application Development Guide chapter on the Attribute
Configuration Language needs to be updated to show usage
syntax for the 1.0.3 ACF attributes (encode, decode, extern_exception,
cs_char, ...) and 1.1 ACF attributes (binding_callout).

The affected file is app_gd/rpc/acf.gpsml.

Assigning this CR to myself (since I'm the OSF writer
who's responsible for IDL documentation).

Full Description:

        The api utc_reltime and utc_ascreltime returns (-1)
        when the input utc time is NULL. The OSF documentation
        says that NULL input is allowed as a default for the
        current time.  However in utc_reltime, NULL input is checked for
        and (-1) is returned.

Repeat By:


Proposed Solution:
       Change the OSF documentation to require a valid utc
       structure containing a relative time. This would be
       more inline with the use of relative time structures.

The description part of sec_login_refresh_identity() says "Any
administrative changes are reflected in the refreshed identity". 

This is not true. THsi function only updates the TGT, not PAC. For example,
if you add this account to an addtional group, this group change (i.e. PAC
change) will NOT reflect by refreshing with this call. Only a new DCE login
will pick up the PAC change.

I remember there was a discusion about whether we should make this fucntion
to really reflect the complete changes, and HP decided to postpone.

There may be other places in the app_gd where the description may be wrong.

The new -c option to uuidgen needs to be documented.

The uuidgen program currently provides three output formats:
 - the "default" just prints the string form of the uuid. 
 -s outputs the uuid as a C static initializer
 -i outputs the uuid as a "template" idl file.

The -c option allows you to supply a pre-existing uuid, which is output by
uuidgen in the output format you select; it makes most sense when used with
"-s" in the event that you're hard-coding a uuid into a program (it's more
efficient that using uuid_from_string() to convert the character string
form, and less error-prone than doing the conversion manually).

The -c must come last on the command line; any options after the -c are
ignored.

typical usage:

% uuidgen -s -c 1251ace6-93a1-11cd-95ad-0800097086e4
    = { /* 1251ace6-93a1-11cd-95ad-0800097086e4 */

The dtsdate command, which allows a local clock to be set from that of
a host running a dtsd server, needs to be documented. This requires
that a manual page should be written, and the following general document
areas should be updated to reflect how and when to utilize this command 

  Installation

  Administration 
     DTS
     DFS

Specifically, the clock constraints amongst the various DCE servers
and hosts need to be more fully documented. Specifically, the clocks
among all DCE components must be within 5 minutes of each other, or
CDS and security will fail. However, DFS file servers have more
stringent requirements (clocks must be within 10 seconds of each
other).

Problems that can arise by setting clocks backwards need to be
emphasized.

[6/29/94 public]

From Charlie Brooks, I have learned that dtsdate is a utility
on the order of getip and dce_config (i.e., it has no relation
to dtscp and/or dcecp). It is primarily used during initial cell
configuration and/or host instantiation into a cell to ensure
that CDS, security, and especially DFS configuration do not
"bog down" due to clock skew.

I'm assigning this CR to Peter Neilson (OSF DTS writer). Charlie
will provide detailed information to help get the command documented.
It looks to me like the man page for dtsdate belongs
in /command_ref/man8dce and the guide information belongs in
the Admin Guide - Introduction in the "Configuring and Starting
Up DCE" part.

The idl compiler now has the following new functionality in it:


Start included text ------------------------

0 Opaque context handle support in DCE 1.1

The unextended IDL compiler allows context handles to be specified by
either of the following methods:
    o use the context_handle attribute on a parameter of type void *.
    o use the context_handle attribute on a type that is defined as void *.

The opaque context handle support allows this additional way to specify
a context handle:
    o use the context_handle attribute on a type that is defined as a
      pointer to a structure by tag name.

The context_handle attribute indicates that the data is a pointer-sized
object that serves as the handle, or method of accessing, some object.
A context handle is opaque to, and must never be written by, the caller
code.  To emphasize this, IDL previously required that context handles be
defined as type (void *).

To the called operation in an RPC server, however, the context handle is
not opaque.  Most often, it is the address of a structure in memory.
Since the IDL-emitted type for the context handle is (void *), the server
code must use casts extensively in its manipulation of the context handle.

The opaque context handle feature alleviates this problem.  A context
handle can be defined as a forward reference to structure type by tag.
Normally, IDL requires that the forward referenced type be subsequently
defined in the IDL file or something it imports.  With the opaque context
handle feature, the forward referenced type need not be defined.  The
IDL-emitted type for the context handle is, for example, (struct foo *).
This type is still opaque to the caller, because struct foo is never
fully defined.  Yet it provides type checking and alleviates the need for
casting in the server code, which can include the actual definition of
struct foo.

0.1 Rules for using opaque context handles

The rules for opaque context handles are the same as for the previously
existing, void *, context handles.

A structure type in a context handle type definition must be referenced by
tag name, not type name.  For example, the first of these declarations is
valid; the second is not.
    typedef [context_handle] struct struct_tag * valid_ch_t;    /* OK */
    typedef [context_handle] struct_type * invalid_ch_t;        /* Error */

A structure type in a context handle type definition may also be defined
in the IDL file, though this is not generally recommended because it
violates the opaqueness of the context handle type.  For example, this
definition could either precede or follow the definition of valid_ch_t.
    typedef struct struct_tag {long l;} struct_type;

0.2 Examples

    /* A "normal" context handle for reference */
    typedef [context_handle] void * void_ch_t;

    /* An "opaque" context handle */
    typedef [context_handle] struct opaque_struct * opaque_ch_t;

    /* Operations using both "normal" and "opaque" context handles */
    void ch_oper(
        [in] void_ch_t v1,
        [in,out] void_ch_t *v2,
        [out] void_ch_t *v3,
        [in] opaque_ch_t o1,
        [in,out] opaque_ch_t *o2,
        [out] opaque_ch_t *o3
    );

    void_ch_t void_ch_oper([in] handle_t h);

    opaque_ch_t opaque_ch_oper([in] handle_t h);

[6/16/94 public]
Discussion about how to free storage when fetching items from a backing
store should be made more clear.  For example, after calling dce_db_fetch()
(or the _by_uuid or _by_name versions), some memory may need to be freed
if the call was made outside of an RPC (server side).  (Since it is
allocated with rpc_sm_allocate(), it is automatically freed in this case.) 
If done outside an RPC, the caller should call rpc_sm_client_free().

This should be discussed in the App Dev Guide in the backing store
discussions, and in manpages for dce_db_fetch() and it's friends.
The dce_db_free() manpage says it doesn't do anything (it can't, really,
due to idl immaturaturity), but a couple sentences on what and how to
free should be mentioned.

As CR 10886 states, you should call rpc_sm_enable_allocate() before
fetch and store operations.  (It says to call it befor store, but the same
is true of fetch.)

For backing store lib doc...

You can not use "conformant arrays" in objects stored to a backing store.
This is because the idl-generated code that encodes (pickles) the structure
can not know how big an array is.  When the object is fetched, the structure
will generally not have enough space provided, and will clobber whatever is
in memory after the structure.

Just to be clear, here is an example.  Suppose the struct in your idl
file is this:

    typedef struct {
	unsigned32          length;
	[size_is(length)]
	unsigned32          numbers[];
    } num_array_t
    typedef struct {
	char		*name;
	num_array_t	na;
    } my_type_t;

idl turns it into this in the .h file:

    typedef struct  {
	unsigned32 length;
	unsigned32 numbers[1];
    } num_array_t
    typedef struct {
	idl_char	*name;
	num_array_t	na;
    } my_type_t;

If you do

    my_type_t  my_struct;
    dce_db_fetch(dbh, key, &my_struct, &st)"

and the array is of length of more than 1, the decoding operation will
clobber what is after my_struct in memory.

Instead, use a pointer to the array, not the array itself.  Eg,

    typedef struct {
	char		*name;
	num_array_t	*na;
    } my_type_t;

Programs that call dce_db_store() outside of a server operation (like
if a server does some backing store initialization, or in a standalone
program) must call rpc_sm_enable_allocate() first.  Actually, each thread that
calls dce_db_store() must do rpc_sm_allocate().  Remember that in the
server side of an RPC, this is already done.

These should be mentioned in the manpage for dce_db_store() and in
examples.

[5/24/94 public]
I have accumulated a number of small technical clarifications that need to
be incorporated into the documentation.  This defect is a wrapper for these
changes.  I'll briefly list the changes and the affected files as I make the
edits.
 
Added field Transarc Deltas with value `' 
Added field Transarc Herder with value `' 
Added field Transarc Status with value `open'

[5/24/94 public]
Updated the following files to indicate that a replication site for a fileset
from one cell cannot exist on a file server in another cell:
 
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/gd/ftavail.gpsml
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/ref/man8dfs/fts_addsite.8dfs

[5/24/94 public]
Added an Exit Values section to the reference page for the dfsexport command,
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/ref/man8dfs/dfsexport.8dfs.  The command's exit
values were thought to be worth mentioning.

[5/24/94 public]
Added the explicit .readonly and .backup restrictions to the discussions of
DFS fileset naming conventions.  You can specify a name that includes either
of these extensions for a new fileset.  The following files were modified:
 
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/gd/ftavail.gpsml
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/gd/issues.gpsml
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/ref/man8dfs/fts_create.8dfs
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/ref/man8dfs/fts_crfldbentry.8dfs
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/ref/man8dfs/fts_rename.8dfs
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/ref/man8dfs/fts_restore.8dfs

[5/25/94 public]
Added information about database access during a Ubik election and subsequent
database distribution.  The information briefly lets the reader know what can
and cannot be done in these situations.  The only file affected was
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/gd/issues.gpsml.

[5/27/94 public]
Corrected text that discussed use of the fts update command; the command is
intended for use with Scheduled Replication.  Also clarified how replicas are
distributed and how some of the replication parameters affect the distribution.
The following files were affected:
 
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/gd/ftavail.gpsml
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/ref/man8dfs/fts_release.8dfs
./dce_books/dfs_admin_gdref/ref/man8dfs/fts_update.8dfs
 
Jeff Prem reviewed the changes.  This is the last miscellaneous clarification
or correction I'm likely to get to for this release, so this defect can be
closed.

The reference pages upclient.8dfs and upserver.8dfs have some mistakes in
their examples, and they are unclear in certain other respects.  This defect
is intended to address these problems.

The Porting Guide needs to be updated with the following information
for DCE 1.1 Beta:

    1. Porting information for the new components and subsystems--
       e.g., dced, dcecp, audit, etc.

       In particular, how to run tests, if any.

    2. GDS Porting information.

    3. ifdef update information for the following:

           DTS (Roger Woodbury)
           Security (Rajendra)

    4. How to run any new functional tests, in particular how to
       run tests under TET.

    5. How to run the serviceability system tests.

[6/1/94 public]

Here are the still-outstanding items for the Porting Guide:


    1. Information on running the dcerpper system test (from Paul
       Ellis)

    2. Information on running the DCEDREL01 system test (from Rick
       Fadden)

    3. System V source file acquisition (USL or SNI?) (Maryanne
       Paratore, SNI) (Willie has this on his list for the Release
       Notes, and I need this information also for Chapter 1 of
       the Porting Guide).

           DTS (Charlie Brooks)
           Security (Rajendra)

This can now be closed. I have all the critical information I'm aware
of for the Beta Porting Guide. Of the three items listed above, 1 turned
out to be a non-issue (the test is not supposed to be executed by users
of Beta), 2 has been settled, and 3 will have to be handled in the next
version (Beta II or whatever); however, they were not regarded as crucial.

Special Notes at the beginning of each chapter of the Beta version of the
Porting Guide describe the state of that chapter for Beta. In summary, the
state is as follows:

   1. (General Intro etc.) Updated throughout, except for the large "Porting
      Order" section in the middle of the chapter.

   2. (DCE Subsystems: Internationalization and Serviceability) This chapter
      is new. It contains information on all the tests available, plus a
      fairly decent survey of the I18N sources, plus all the "Porting Con-
      siderations"-type info I have.

   3. (dcecp, dced, ACL library) This chapter is new. It has information
      on all available tests, a reasonable set of oher sections on dcecp,
      and fairly skeletal sections on dced and the ACL library (except for
      the tests).

   4. (Threads) Unchanged for Beta.

   5. (RPC) Updated throughout for Beta.

   6. (CDS) Test sections updated.

   7. (GDS) Updated throughout for Beta.

   8. (DTS) Test sections updated.

   9. (Security) Test sections updated, and DES section updated.

   10. (Audit) This chapter is new. Contains adequate versions of all sections,
       except that the survey of source code is skeletal.

   11. (DFS) Unchanged for Beta, except that the long "Porting OSI" section that
       was in the 1.0.3a Release Notes has been added.

   12. (ODE, libdce, etc.) Unchanged for Beta.

   13. (System Test) Updated throughout.

   Both appendixes are unchanged.

Following is from mail from rps:

The "item_cursor" Parameter paragraphs in

sec_rgy_pgo_get_by_id
        pgo_get_by_name
        pgo_get_by_unix_num
        unix_getgrgid
        unix_getgrnam
        unix_getpwnam
        unix_getpwuid

look like they were cut&pasted from sec_rgy_pgo_get_next(), but should
instead refer to their respective calls.

Also, sec_rgy_pgo_get_by_name's item_cursor is listed as Output when it
should be Input/Output.

Finally, sec_rgy_unix_getpwnam is inconsistent with respect to the
way it specifies *<out-parameter-name> in the Parameter list paragraphs.

[8/30/94 public]
Fixed and verified.  Verified by me.

[09/06/94 public]

This defect addresses the need to add some missing steps to the configuration
of a Tape Coordinator machine for use with the DFS Backup System.  The missing
information applies only to configuration of DCE clients that are not also DFS
server machines of some type.  Basically, a client-only machine needs to have
a DFS server principal (hosts/<hostname>/dfs-server) created for it, and this
principal needs to be added to the appropriate DFS administrative group
(subsys/dce/dfs-admin).

[5/19/94 public]
The additional steps were added to the appropriate section, and necessary

following files were modified:

The bulk of the changes (the new material) were made to the file backup.gpsml.
All changes were verified by Abhijit Khale, Steve Lammert, and myself (the
missing information was promptly provided by Abhijit).  This one can be closed.

The man page of sec_rgy_site_open() does not say the the caller should have
a network identity (login context) to succeed. Nor does the man page list 
error code (0x171220ec: No currently established network identity for which 
context exists ) as a possible return error.

sec_rgy_site_open() is really just like sec_rgy_site_bind() with defaults
supplied for the auth_info parameter, which attempt to use the default login
context for the process.  

Please fix this man page, also check other sec_rgy_site man pages.

Created a new chapter describing how to use subtree commands to restructure
CDS directories: subtree.gpsml, Using the CDS Subtree Commands to Restructure
CDS Directories.  This chapter will replace the current Chapter 11 in the
Administration Guide. The current Chapter 11, Restructuring a Namespace,
will become Chapter 12.

Also created 10 reference pages for the subtree commands. The reference
pages will be incorporated into the Administration Reference manual. They
are: delete_subtree.8cds, dump_subtree.8cds, merge_file.8cds,
merge_subtree.8cds, recreate_directory.8cds, recreate_link.8cds,
recreate_object.8cds, replace_link.8cds, replace_object.8cds,
replace_subtree.8cds.OA

[5/20/94 public]

DEC has delivered submitted Ch 11 to the doc tree and put the ref pages in
an invalid location (in the obsoleted admin_gd).  We will remove the ref
pages to the code tree nosupport tree and will move them to the command_ref
directory in the doc tree only if OSF supports this functionality in cdscp.
OSF is writing dcecp documentation for the equivalent functionality.

[5/23 public]
Ch 11 has now been added to the Description file fore book.core.

[09/08/93 public]
Note the following statement from Hal Lichtin on 9/7/94:

"The DEC subtree pages are obsolete.  The subtree operations have been
subsumed in the dcecp reference pages.  OSF did the coding, and Ward put
the information in the relevant page (directory.8dce, I believe is the only
page affected.  So the Admin part can be "closed" or "canceled" as being
subsumed by the standard dcecp CR."

This CR can be closed as soon as Howard Melman reviews the Subtree
chapter for the Admin Guide.

The sec_key_mgmt_get_next_key() manpage should say that the principal_name
output param is allocated and should be freed, with free()  (lest you end
up with a memory leak).  It correctly says to use sec_key_mgmt_key() to
free the key itself.

I need to find a way to discuss an ACL's default cell much earlier in the DFS
chapter that discusses DCE ACLs with DFS objects.  My current approach at this
description is pretty misleading because it fails to consider the default cell
when it initially presents the concepts of local and foreign cells and users
with respect to ACLs.  An understanding of the default cell is integral to a
proper understanding of the various ACL entries and how they are interpreted.

I did a lot of reorganization to the chapter to present the ACL default
cell description much earlier in the chapter.  I also made some additional
corrections and edits to my previous work for defect 8118.  In general, I
spent a lot of time reorganizing this chapter for purposes of improved
clarity.  Rajesh Agarwalla reviewed all of my changes (in addition to the
remainder of the chapter), providing many helpful comments and suggestions.

[5/5/94 public]
There is wrong and inadequate guidance on how to use the sec_passwd_rec_t
type to pass a password string to such routines as sec_login_validate_identity.
First, the descriptions of sec_passwd_rec_t in chapter 5 of the Ref Man
(under LOGIN API DATA TYPES and KEY MANAGEMENT API DATA TYPES) do not
capture the definition in share/include/dce/passwd.h.

The use of this record in the ref page on sec_login_validtate_identity
is not sufficiently described.  You might set it up as:

passwd_rec.version_number = sec_passwd_c_version_none;
passwd_rec.pepper = NULL;
passwd_rec.key.key_type = sec_passwd_plain;

sec_passwd_str_t      tmp_passwd;

strncpy((char *) tmp_passwd, (char *) my_passwd, sec_passwd_str_max_len);
tmp_passwd[sec_passwd_str_max_len] = '\0';
passwd_rec.key.tagged_union.plain = &(tmp_passwd[0]);

The above is lifted from security/client/admin/rgy_edit/ek_db.c

Customer reported:

        The V1.0.3 IDL compiler generates server stub code that puts a
        parameter of a scalar type on the stack even if the "heap"
        attribute has been specified for it in an ACF file.  Is it
        supposed to work this way?  I've scanned the documentation and
        can't find any indication that the "heap" attribute is not
        supposed to work for scalars.  The V1.0.2 IDL compiler puts
        scalar types with the "heap" attribute in heap memory.

I tried 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 idls and saw the problem reported. If this is a
desired change, please properly document it (this is the reason I put OT
7730 "explain use of acf heap attribute" as related).

Repeat By:

        The following .idl and .acf files will demonstrate the problem
        for "long int *":

/*********************************************************************/

/*
 * Test IDL file

        (
        [in]       long int            *aint
        );

} /** END of IDL file ***/

/*********************************************************************/

                         [heap] aint
                         );
} /* End of ACF file */


[5/5 public]
This is the intended behavior, as the following code fragment illustrates:
                            if (ref_type_p->kind != AST_pipe_k
                                && !AST_CONTEXT_SET(param_p)
                                && !AST_CONTEXT_RD_SET(ref_type_p)
                                && !type_is_scalar(ref_type_p))
                                AST_SET_HEAP(param_p);

The [heap] attribute is ignored for pipes, context handles, and scalars.

This should be a documentation defect.


[5/5 public]

Care to explain why this change? I mean from the code above, it looks like
that this is an intended new behavior. There must be reason(s) behind this
change (since 1.0.2). I think the document people need to know this reason
too to explain why in the documentation.

[6/8/94 public]

Assigned this CR to myself - I'm the OSF writer who's
responsible for the IDL documentation.

[9/6/94 public]

Due to time and resource constraints, this CR cannot be
addressed in the DCE 1.1 timeframe. Marking this CR deferred
until DCE 1.2.

[9/6/94 public]

Howard Melman suggests that an easy way to address this CR
would be to add the following text in the places where the
heap attribute is described:

 "The [heap] attribute is ignored for pipes, context handles,
  and scalars".

I think this fix can be made in the DCE 1.1 timeframe, so
I'm reopening the CR.

DCE 1.1 will no longer support compatibility to NCS, since
it is an entirely different product and since several versions
of DCE have now been released. NCS users should have converted
to DCE RPC by now.

As a result, all of the NCS compatibility documentation needs
to be removed from the Application Development Guide and Reference.
This impacts both RPC documentation (owned by J. Shirley) and
IDL documentation (owned by L. Zahn).

[5/5/94 public]
Removed IDL-related documentation for NCS compatiblity from
app_gd and app_ref.  Affected files are:

/command_ref/man1rpc/nidl_to_idl.1rpc - removed
/command_ref/man1rpc/rpc_intro.1rpc
/app_gd/rpc/9_idl.gpsml
/app_gd/rpc/11_ncs_v1_issues.gpsml - removed

Still need to check and remove cross-references.

[5/5/94 public]

This functionality MUST still be supported in the rpcd.  There
are still applications that depend on license servers that use
NCS and the rpcd and llbd both use port 135.  I wish all NCS
applications were moved up to DCE but this is not reality yet.

[5/5/94 public]

Note, that lldb will be ported to dced and shipped with dce 1.1.

The rest of the NCS 1.5 support has been removed in the rpc code 
cleanup.

[5/11/94 public]

(I think "lldb" should be "llbd" (Local Location Broker Daemon))

Removed references to IDL-related NCS compatibility features.
Checked for cross-references to defuncted NCS compatibility
chapter but didn't find any. As of now, all of the documentation
for IDL/RPC NCS compatibility features has been removed from
the app_ref and the app_gd. The revised documentation needs
technical review before this CR can be changed to "verified".

The mavros tests have changed somewhat and the instructions in the porting
guide must be changed.  They are in section 5.5.6 (MAVROS Compiler Tests)
of the DCE1.0.3 version of the Doc.

Here's a summary of the needed changes.  See me if you need more detail.

- remove the sentence which begins 'Part of the test procedure is executed
during the build ..."

- Delete the paragraph (the 2nd?) which begins "Most files required to
complete and execute the test drivers ..."  Replace this with:

	There are two dependencies upon the files exported during
	the GDS portion of the build: asn1.h and libdce.  libdce contains
	the ASN1 library.  Asn1.h is expected to be found either in the
	directory in which you are running the MAVROS test script, or in
	the export tree of your sandbox.  

- Remove the sentence "There are five steps in test procedure design:"
  Replace with: "Running the MAVROS compiler test consists of executing the
  test_mvr.sh script.  This is what it does:"

- Delete steps 1, 2 and 3.

- Rename step 4 to 1.
	(Change reference to "obj tree" to "install tree")

- Rename step 5 to 2.
	(Change reference to "obj tree" to "install tree")

DEC has provided OSF with the source changes to support the following
functionality which should be documented in the right places.

DEC provided this initial doc spec.

begin-text----------------------------------------------

0 Extended string support in DCE 1.1

The unextended IDL compiler implements strings as one-dimensional arrays
to which the [string] attribute is assigned.  The element type of the
array must resolve to one of the following:
    o Type char
    o Type byte
    o A structure all of whose members are of type byte or of a named
      type that resolves to byte
    o A named type that resolves to one of the previous three types
For simplicity these element types are referred to as "byte types" and
strings built from these types are referred to as "byte string types".

The extended string support adds these string element types:
    o Type unsigned short
    o Type unsigned long
    o A named type that resolves to unsigned short or unsigned long
For simplicity these element types are referred to as "integer types" and
strings built from these types are referred to as "integer string types".

The string extensions allow for multi-octet character sets whose
characters are represented by 16-bit or 32-bit quantities, rather than
as groups of bytes.  These extensions support the Unicode standard.

0.1 Rules for Using Integer String Types

The rules for integer string types are similar to those for byte string
types.  An array of integer type with the [string] attribute represents a
string of characters.  An array element of value 0 represents the string
terminator, similar to the NULL character in a string of byte type.  The
number of characters in the string array includes the 0 terminator, and
the entire terminated string is passed between stubs.

The restrictions that apply to byte string types also apply to integer
string types.

As with the byte string types, the [string] attribute may be applied to
a pointer to an integer type.  The [string] attribute converts the pointee
from a single integer to an array of integers, to which string semantics
apply.

0.2 Examples

/* A string type that holds 80 characters */
typedef [string] unsigned short string_t[81];

/* A structure containing a fixed string and a conformant string */
typedef unsigned long PRIVATE_CHAR_32;
typedef struct {
    [string] PRIVATE_CHAR_32 fixed[27];
    [string] PRIVATE_CHAR_32 conf[];
} two_strings;

/* A structure containing pointers to two strings */
typedef unsigned short PRIVATE_CHAR_16;
typedef struct {
    [string] PRIVATE_CHAR_16 *astring;
    [string] PRIVATE_CHAR_16 *bstring;
} stringptrs;

[4/25/94 public]
I spoke with Dave Griffith at DEC and it turns out the 2nd paragraph in the
description of set_directory_to_new_epoch.8cds is incorrect

  .PP
  .zA "defect,6045,R1.0.2, "Added description"
  When you set a new epoch on a directory, you must disable the clearinghouse
  containing the replica that is being excluded.  To do this, use the 
  \*Ldisable server\*O command (if  the server has more than one 
  clearinghouse, all its clearinghouses will be disabled).  If you are 
  assigning a new 
  master, both the clearinghouse that contains the current master and the one
  to contain the new master must be enabled and accessible before you 
  issue this command.
  .zZ "defect,6045,R1.0.2, "Added description"

The clearinghouse that contains the current master does not have to be
reachable.  That would defeat most of the purpose of this command.  Dave
had many problems with this paragraph, please see him or someone else at
DEC for more details.

This defect addresses moving the necessary DFS User's Guide information into
the DFS Admin Guide.  Lisa Zahn completed the preliminary work for this defect.
I will now complete the process to make sure we convert everything we need and
to ensure that I get everything done properly.  Lisa has already briefed me all
of her work, so I have a good handle on where we are at and what remains to be
done.

This submission represents the first of two submissions I'll make for this
defect; it includes most of the files I need to edit.  Most of the files
include change bars for defect 10440.  Some do not include change bars for
this defect; in such cases, the changes I made to the files fall into one
or more of the following categories:
 
o Changes that, while associated with the converion of user text to admin
  text, were too small to really legitimize inclusion of change bars.
o Small editorial changes to correct previous style, format, or writing
  mistakes, most of which were made by Keith or me in previous submissions.
o Small editorial changes for consistency with other files and changes.
 
Please let me know of any questions or comments regarding any of my changes.
Note that the bulk of my effort has been made much easier by previous work
done recently at OSF by Lisa Zahn and Bob Mathews.

[4/25/94 public]
I submitted the final DFS file in which former User's Guide information needed
to be included.  The file is named
 
./src/dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/3_aclgroup_dfs.gpsml
 
All changes are indicated with the appropriate change bars.  I verified the
changes manually.  The bulk of the changes were to include wording and
organization from the User's Guide where I thought it was superior to its
counterpart in the Admin Guide.  I could drag this out ad infinitum, but I
think I picked up the important information.
 
This wraps up this defect from my end.  Please feel free to close off the
defect whenever you get the chance.  Thanks.

This defect covers making all of the cross-references in the DFS documentation
conform to the new structure.  Because of the current schedule, I will probably
address this defect in two stages.  I will fix the references I can for now;
once we decide on book or two for the DFS documentation, I will fix the
references to the documenmt titles.

I fixed all internal and external cross-references in all of the documents.
As an added bonus, I also fixed all document references to use the SML macros
defined in the bookdefs.mac file.  Previously, such references spelled out the
names of the documents; as Hal pointed out, this approach led to problems when
we needed to rename a document.  (I should have done this long ago.)
 
Anyway, I visually verified output for all of the affected files.  This one
can be closed.

As a result of App Dev Guide reorg, the following tasks need
to be completed for the Intro to DCE:

(1) Fix crossrefs to the old book title (App Dev Guide).  The right thing
to do is to use the appropriate strings from bookdefs.mac.

(2) Fix internal crossrefs (chapter and section numbers).

The affected files for App Dev Guide titles are:

The "dtscp show last synchronization" command indicates that a sync has
completed even when the sync fails.
The testcase tests the value in "dtscp show last synchroniization" and
"dtscp show synchronizations complete" before and after issuing the
"dtscp sync" command.  The "sync complete" did not get updated because
too few servers were detected, but the "last sync" value was updated
to the last attempted sync.  The documentation indicates that this value
should only be updated if the sync is complete, not just attempted.

The system test group has to work around this to get the test to complete.

[04/20/94 public]
I believe this is the last time a syncronization was *attempted*.
I do not believe (and it it hasn't been the case since it was written)
this indicated the last time a successful sync was completed.

Your test should not depend on this.

I tend to think this is a doc bug.  The OSF docs say:
"Specifies the computed time at the last syncronization."

What do the IBM docs say?

[04/21/94 public]
 The IBM docs say: "Specifies the computed time at the last syncronization"
 The IBM docs say: "Specifies the computed time at the last syncronization"
 If the sync had not been successful it would not have syncronized, thus
 would not be the last syncronization. Also when the "dtscp show last sync"
 command is issued it reads "Last Syncronization =" also indicating that
 the sync completed.

 I agree that it might be a doc problem but I think that the OSF docs need 
 to read attempted sync, and change the output from dtscp to also read
 Last Attempted Sync.    What are your thoughts?

[04/21/94 public]

I agree, it has always annoyed me that the last sync time isn't the time
of the last successful sync.  Perhaps it should say "Last Attempted
Synchronization" instead of "Last Synchronization"?

[04/21/94 public]
I think the doc is certainly unclear and should be fixed.
I am less sure that any code needs to be changed.

[8/11/94 public]
yes this is a doc bug.  The attribute is the time of the last ATTEMPTED
synchronization.

I (Marll McDonald) am changing several files to reflect a change to DCE
Security software.  The full description of the change is in the
document "Adding Group Override Support to DCE Security" that Digital
engineer Joe Comuzzi created.  Joe wrote this document in response to
OSF's Request For Comments number 55.0.

Next are the names of the documentation files I am changing.

app_ref/man3sec/sec_rgy_pgo_get_by_eff_unix_num.3sec (new file)
admin_gd/security/security/8_maint.gpsml
admin_ref/man8sec/passwd_export.8sec
app_gd/security/4_rgy.gpsml

I plan to make some changes to the Porting and Testing Guide, but
will follow Hal Lichtin's suggestion and send the changes directly
to Doug Weir instead of making them through the ODE.

Digital engineer Brian Hasbrouck is making the changes to the software.
He has also reviewed my changes to the documentation.

[04/28/94]

(Entered by Marll McDonald.)

The previous list of affected files is incorrect.  Next is the correct list.

app_ref/man3sec/sec_rgy_pgo_get_by_eff_unix_num.3sec (new file)
admin_gd/overview/overview/9_tasks.gpsml
admin_gd/security/security/8_maint.gpsml
command_ref/man8sec/passwd_export.8sec

I changed the previous five files according to Joe Comuzzi's document.
I found no need to change the Porting and Testing Guide.

There is no section in the admin guide that describes adding or changing
attributes in CDS entries (objects, directories, etc.).  Chapter 10 is
"Viewing the Structure and Contents of a Namespace" which is great.
Chapter 11 is "Restructuring a Namespace" which talks about softlinks,
replications, deleting a directory or clearinghouse and moving
clearinghouses.  There is nothing that talks about:

  what an attribute is (not even in the opening chapters!!)
  attribute syntaxes
  attributes used internally by CDS
  adding user defined attributes 
  The cds_attributes file
  single vs multi-valued attributes
  using the "add" or "remove" commands in cdscp (modify in dcecp)

CDS is meant to store data and we don't describe how to do this.  Only how
to replicate and move data that is already in there.  There should be a new
chapter between the existing Chapters 10 and 11.

I was just going through the reported defects, and I noticed this one.  As I
was correcting and verifying text for defect 10440, I already fixed all of
the necessary cross-references in the five DFS introductory references pages
that are listed.  I hope this isn't a problem.  The changes were pretty
inconsequential, and I didn't realize this defect existed for them.  Anyway,
I made them as I was in there doing other things.  I think I got them all;
you can verify the changes to make sure I did.

According to CR10340, filed under the GDS component, several
tables in the chapter "XDS and the DCE Cell Namespace" within
Part 4A, "CDS Application Programming" of the Application Development
Guide need to be corrected. See CR10340 for the details
and background information. It is my understanding that Digital
owns this section of the Application Development Guide, so I'm
assigning this CR to Ron Johnson (DEC DCE 1.1 writer).

Modfied severity/priority to match CR10340.

[10/25/94]

Never Adressed by DEC.  Deferred to 1.2

[9/14/95 public]

Reopening this bug and assigning it, at least temporarily, to
myself. Despite what Hal thought (see immediately above), I'm
pretty sure this bug was all fixed. No time to check at the
moment though.

[2/27/96 public]

Reduced the severity and deferred to 1.2.2.

Use of the RPC_RESTRICTED_PORTS feature should be explained somewhere
in the Administration Guide. The information is currently in Chapter
3 of the Porting Guide, in a section called ``RPC Endpoint Restriction''.
The section as it is there could probably just be copied or moved from
the Porting Guide chapter to the appropriate place in the Admin Guide,
wherever that is.

When Show Directory or Show Replica are done using CDSCP, after the SHOW 
DIRECTORY AT lines appears RPC_ClassVersion = 0100.  The DCE Administration
Reference does not show this attribute for either Show Directory or Show
Replica, and the examples of the output do not show this attribute.  Is it 
an error in the code that it displays, or is it an error in the 
documentation that it is not described?

[8/3/94 public]
The attribute should be displayed, it represents the rpc runtime software
version that can be used to import on the directory.  This is done by acl_edit.
the other import attributes are made up on the fly.  I have changed this
to a documentation bug. Since it is old control program stuff I lower it to a 4.

[08/09/94 public]

[08/23/94 public]
Changed priority to "2" and severity to "C".

[09/04/94 public]
Added the RPC_ClassVersion attribute to the list of
attributes and descriptions and to the sample displays
for the following two ref pages:

	command_ref/man8cds/show_directory.8cds
	command_ref/man8cds/show_replica.8cds

Also described the CDS_RingPointer attribute, which showed up 
in the sample display for show_directory.8cds, on both of
these ref pages.

This CR covers removal of all diskless documentation from the DCE doc set.
The agreement between engineering and doc folk is that the diskless
documentation should simply be removed and not put into the supp_docs
directory.

[4/11/94 public]
I have now removed all disless documentation from the regular doc set,
*except* the release notes.  The main books affected are the Administration
Guide, Command Reference, Introduction to DCE, and Porting and Testing
Guide.  Whoever prepares the 1.1 release notes should get rid of any
mention of diskless, except to say that it is no longer supported and its
documentation has been removed.
I did fix all cross-references to diskless documentation that I could find.
I also fixed a number of figures to remove references to diskless support
or to things that applied only to diskless systems.
One other issue remains.  In the course of this work, I removed
documentation for two DFS options that were documented to apply only to
diskless systems.  These are the -rootcell option to dfsd and the -global
option to fts crmount.  I commented out all DFS documentation rather than
simply remove it so that any errors I made could be corrected easily.  The
following files are affected:
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/2_issues_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/6_ftavail_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/8_cachemgr_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_ref/man8dfs/dfsd.8dfs
./dce_books/admin_ref/man8dfs/fts_crmount.8dfs
I have sent these files to Jeff Kaminski at Transarc.  Jeff has offered to
review the changes.  His first reaction was that the options should be
documented anyway.  If so, someone will have to come up with some alternate
wording that does not mention diskless systems.

[4/20/94 public]
I reviewed the five DFS files for Bob.  In each case, I rewrote some text
as a result of the diskless removal.  In some cases, I rewrote an option
description; in others, I rewrote an example or some descriptive text.
When in doubt, I had new text reviewed by Craig Everhart or Pervaze Akhtar,
and we are all comfortable with the resulting wording.
All diskless references have been removed from the following files:
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/2_issues_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/6_ftavail_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/8_cachemgr_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_ref/man8dfs/dfsd.8dfs
./dce_books/admin_ref/man8dfs/fts_crmount.8dfs
I changed this defect to verified; I think I was the obstacle to this state,
and from the DFS doc perspective, it can now be closed.  I included Hal on
the cc list due to Bob's recent departure.
Changed Interest List CC from `jeff@transarc.com' to `jeff@transarc, 
 hal@osf.org' 
Changed Status from `open' to `verified' 
Filled in Fixed In Baseline with `1.1' 
Filled in Affected File with `See Description'

I opened a new CR to cover removing diskless info from
Release Notes. I'll close this CR once I verify changes
in next doc build.

In working on the DTS error messages, I came across some confusing items in
the OSF DCE Administration Guide--Core Components concerning DTS>

1.  Page 14-5 states:

    For each remote clerk, set the servers required characteristic in the
    range 3g, where g equals the number of global servers that are in the
    network. 

    It is not clear to me how the user sets these global servers.  The
    syntax for set servers required [integer] doesn't explain how to set
    the value for g as indiacted in the Admin Guide.  Given the statement
    above, it would appear someone would say

    set required servers 35 where 5 would be the number of global servers,
    but I don't believe that's correct.

2.  Page 15-16 states:

    ...use the set command with the epoch number characteristic to isolate
    probelm servers...

    From the syntax shown in the Admin Reference, the set command doesn't
    take epoch number as a modifiable characteristic.  I suspect this should
    say the show command with epoch number.

The arrows between DTS servers in Figure 2-5 
(in /admin_gd/overview/overview/2_comp.gpsml)
need to go both ways because DTS servers send
information to each other. Also, it might help
to note in the accompanying text that the arrows
in the figure reflect the flow of information, rather
than the flow of requests, between clerks and servers.
(because time clerks have to query time servers for time
in order to get them to send the time.) Also, the "API" boxes
(except for API/client circle) should be deleted
because they aren't relevant to sys admins.

[4/18/94 public]

Reassigning this CR to Peter Neilson (OSF DTS writer).

[09/20/94 public]
Figure 2-2 (not 2-5 as stated above) corrected by adjusting the pic
code that is included directely in 2-comp.gpsml.  Although the pic code is
obviously output from xpic, no xpic files were discovered in the nearby
"xpic" or "pic" directories, and there was no "figures" directory.

Verified by tom.

[09/20/94 public]
Corrected "Verified by" line above.  Tom Jordahl, not rsalz, verified it.

[10/25/94 public]
Closed bug.

The file 2_comp.gpsml has since been defuncted (see CR 7501),
so, sadly, the improvements to this figure have also disappeared.
I did a quick scan of the Intro book, and the only DTS figure
in it seems to have the server arrows going both ways, so
we can be reasonably confident that the misleading figure does 
not appear elsewhere in the DCE doc.

This CR covers renaming of the DCE Administration Reference to the DCE
Command Reference and related reorganization, including moving command
reference pages from the DCE Application Reference to the new book.

[4/4/94 public]
I've done most of the structural work.  A couple of remaining tasks (among
others):
(1) Regularize the intro ref pages.  For example, man1dce and man8dce do
not now have intro pages.  Both man1rpc and man8rpc have intro pages, which
appear in the same chapter; it might be a good idea to combine these into a
single intro page.
(2) Fix crossrefs to the book.  The right thing to do is to change these to
use the string from bookdefs.mac.  Following is a list of definite or
possible crossrefs to the book:

Everything recommendation in this CR has either been implemented in the

The one exception is an intro page for the man1dce section of the

[3/31/94 public]

The only architecturally safe way to pass around references to 
DCE servers is by way of protocol towers;  string bindings are not
*guaranteed* to work when passed across the wire.

Since the tower API is currently private to the runtime, there is no
way for applications to do this type of thing safely.

Of immediate concern are the trigger binding fields included in the
schema entries managed through the security ERA APIs.  These bindings 
may be stored in three formats:

    - server entry name (for use with rpc_ns_binding_import calls)
    - string binding (for use with rpc_binding_from_string_binding)
    - protocol towers (for use with rpc_tower_to_binding).

This, of course, presupposes that whoever is updating these fields
can generate the towers they're interested in.

[03/31/94 public]
We've talked about this within the OSF DCE group and we agree
that this should be done.  The biggest impediment is assessing the
doc impact.

[04/01/94 public]
Added Dick, Art, and Hal to the interest list.

Is this a doc or a code issue?  I think it's a doc issue.  Where you thinking
of making code changes Mark?  If not, then let's turn this into a doc
bug and specify the routines that need to be made public:
	rpc_tower_to_binding
	rpc_tower_vector_from_binding
	rpc_tower_vector_free
And document in the app dev guide that a tower is the network rep of a
binding.  Servers that need to support referrals (e.g., those
mentioned in ERA attributes or those doing master/slave replication for
rdaclif) will need these routines to hack on opaque data types.  Nobody
else will.  Right?

[4/8/94 public]

The problem with exposing the routines as they now stand is that there
is a mismatch between what the tower data structure is, and what we're
making public.  That is, towers may contain i/f and transfer syntax info,
but the current calls only allow access to the binding information.

I would hate to think that someday we'll decide to make the whole tower
public, and need to add yet more calls to the API:

    rpc_tower_to_binding_etc(tower, &binding, &if, &xfer_syntax);
    rpc_tower_from_binding_etc(&tower, binding, if, xfer_syntax);they 

Perhaps the right thing to do is to make the _etc routines public (suitably
named), and leave the current tower routines private.  (The _etc
routines would then provide the same functionality if called with the 
i/f and xfer-syntax args set to NULL.)  Make sense?

[4/14/94 public]

Not really. 

As Joe Pato points out, the tower structure may someday change, so we can't
guarantee that we won't end up adding more routines later.  Since the current
routines meet the needs of all parties that have requested access to towers,
let's make those public, and worry about the future later.

Turned into a doc bug, see Rich's mail above for the routines that need to
be documented.

Subject: Making parts of the tower API public

OT CR 10263 discusses how we need to document part of the RPC tower
interface.  Briefly, the ERA and RDACL interfaces have the concept of
a "referral" where a read-only slave can direct a client to the read-write
master.

We're not going to tell people a great deal about how to do this, but it's
wrong to if we don't at least document the routines they'll need to call. :-)

I think most people will be confused by what follows -- you can probalby
just skip this.  A few people will understand and be even able to see if
I get it all right.  RPC guru's, you listening? :-)  One of you will
have to understand this well enough to document it.  Please comment.

The basic concept is that if a server wants to tell a client "go speak
to THAT server", the IDL interface must have some kind of referral operation
and related datatype.  The referal type can be any kind of array of towers,
more or less.  The sec_acl_tower_set_t typedef in rdaclbase.idl is a
good one to use.  It is basically an array of pointers to towers.
You also need the server-stub ifspec in order to build the tower.

Here is a psuedo-code for a server that wants to create a set of referral
towers.  Start with a few variables:
	rpc_tower_vector_t *twr_vec;
	rpc_binding_vector_t *bindings;
	rpc_id_handle_t SERVER_v1_0_s_ifspec; /* declared in the IDL-generated
	server-stub header file. */

	rpc_server_inq_bindings(bindings)
	/* Loop over the bindings returned. */
	for (i = 0 i < bindings->count; i++) {
	    /* Get an unresolved binding (endpoint) to this host and
	     * turn it into a tower vector.  One endpoint can become
	     * multiple towers. */
	    rpc_binding_copy(bindings->binding_h[i], &temp);
	    rpc_binding_reset(temp)
	    rpc_tower_vector_from_binding(SERVER_v1_0_s_ifspec, temp, &twr_vec);
	    rpc_binding_free(temp);
	    for (j = 0; j < twr_vec->count; j++) {
		/* Append twr_vec->tower[j] to a tower list; how to do this
		 * will depend on what the referral operation wants as its
		 * output. */
	    }

This routine should be called once during server init time, if only because
we never free the tower vector and have a slight memory leak.  (We could
free the tower vector if the "Append..." section copied the tower but for
brevity here I didn't sketch that out.  At any rate, rpc_tower_vector_free
does just what you think it does, if we were to revise the code so that
we could use it.)

Code that does this is in security/server/rs/rs.c, the
rpc_tower_vector_from_binding function.  It's a little tough to figure
out what's happening without bouncing around a bit.

A client who needs to process a referral and get a binding handle does
something like this:
	for ( /* loop over all towers we got back. */ ) {
	    rpc_tower_to_binding(list[i]->tower_octet_string, &binding)
	    /* Take the first tower that is compatible -- i.e., it's a
	     * network protcol we support. */
	    if (st == error_status_ok) break;
	}
	if (st != error_status_ok) fatal_error("Can't get there from here.")

Code that does this is in security/client/acl/daclbind.c, the
sec__acl_rebind_update function.  It's more straight-forward.

Here are the datatypes we need to document
	rpc_tower_vector_t (in rpcbase.idl)
	Mention a typical referral type (rdacl's sec_acl_tower_set_t)

Here are the routines we need to document (prototypes in rpcpvt.idl)
	rpc_tower_to_binding
	rpc_tower_vector_from_binding
	rpc_tower_vector_free

Comments?
	/r$

[8/29/94 public]

Should we just force rpc_tower_vector_from_binding to return 
towers with parially bound endpoints?

The intent of the caller is create a reference that can be used 
"later", in the same way that a reference put into the name space
is used "later".  For the same reason, you'd expect this new 
reference to be parially bound.

Allowing rpc_tower_vector_from_binding to create fully-bound towers
just makes using the function harder (i.e., copy and reset), and
makes it easier for developers to do the wrong thing.

[08/29/94 public]
Mark, I'm assuming sinc you didn't call me a dunderhead that I got
the details right. :-)  I think it's too late to change towervec_from_binding
to return partially-bound towers, and I'm not convinced it is the right
thing.  If I know the master is up I'm okay, and this can save me the
hassle of having to do set_object in my binding handle, right?

How about a towervec_from_binding_vec that does most of the above
code?

[09/19/94 public]
Created man pages -
  ./dce_books/app_ref/man3rpc/rpc_tower_to_binding.3rpc
  ./dce_books/app_ref/man3rpc/rpc_tower_vector_free.3rpc
  ./dce_books/app_ref/man3rpc/rpc_tower_vector_from_binding.3rpc
These have been verified by rsalz.

An explanation of the use of tower needs to be added to the Applications
Guide.  This work is deferred to 1.2.

[09/20/94 public]
Just to avoid confusion, I'm marking this one open (don't know affected
files, e.g., else I'd mark as fixed) and opening a new one to talk about
the app dev guide work.

[09/20/94]
Marked as verified.

In Chapter 8 of the administration guide, section 8.7 describes the
proper way to backup the CDS files when doing a OS upgrade. 
This section lacks completeness and clarity. There are considerations 
and steps that the user (reader) needs to be aware of and have been
left out or not properly referenced.

Missing considerations:

1. Preserving a clearinghouse across DCE upgrades. In this case,
   is the procedure to preserve a clearinghouse the same as when
   doing an OS upgrade? 

2. What happens to the name space (CDS server and clerk) while the
   the backup is being performed?  The CDS server and clerk must be 
   disable. Here, the term disable means that cdsd is stopped, 
   and subsequently all requests to CDS will fail. The user should 
   be made aware of the fact that CDS cannot be placed in maintenance 
   mode. 

3. If the cell happens to have only one cdsd - one clearinghouse,
   the cell principals will experience operational difficulties
   while the CDS servers are down. If one is doing a backup and
   restore of a large namespace, this could take a long time.

4. What are additional considerations a DCE administrator should
   keep in mind when backing up the cell CDS namespace as suppossed 
   to just a clearinghouse?

5. Where is the restore procedure defined? Are there required 
   steps the administrator should follow before and after 
   restoring the cell master clearinghouse? 

Missing steps:

. Step 1. should be disable clerk and server.

. additional steps should be added if one needs to backup more
  that one clearignhouse or a cell CDS namespace.

. how to restore a clearinghouse after having upgraded the OS and/or
  DCE.

Sections 8.8.1 and 8.8.2 should also be revised. These sections are too
general.

sec_rgy_unix_getgrnam() does not recognize implicit members of a
group; ie, principals that are members by virtue of the fact that the 
group is the primary group of the principal's account.  The API does
recognize those members of a group who have been added explicitly (via 
the rgy_edit "member <group> -a <member>" subcommand). 

The little program below can be used to illustrate this behavior.


#include <dce/acct.h>
#include <dce/binding.h>
#include <macros.h>

main(argc, argv)
  int   argc;
  char  *argv[];
{
  char                  gname[1024];
  char                  *site = "/.:/";
  sec_rgy_cursor_t      cursor;
  sec_rgy_unix_group_t  g_entry;
  signed32              num_members;
  sec_rgy_member_t      member_list[100];
  int                   i;
  sec_rgy_handle_t      h;
  error_status_t        st;

  if (argc != 2) {
      printf("usage: gr <group>\n");
      exit(1);
  }

  strncpy(gname, argv[1], strlen(argv[1]) + 1);

  sec_rgy_site_open(site, &h, &st);
  printf("sec_rgy_site_open returns %d\n", st);

  if (GOOD_STATUS(&st)) {
      sec_rgy_cursor_reset(&cursor);
      sec_rgy_unix_getgrnam(h, gname, strlen(gname), 100,
                            &cursor, &g_entry, &num_members,
                            member_list, &st);
  }

  printf("sec_rgy_unix_getgrnam returns %d\n", st);

  if (GOOD_STATUS(&st)) {
    printf("num_members = %d\n", num_members);
    for (i = 0; i < num_members; i++) {
        printf("member_list[%d] = %s\n", i, member_list[i]);
    }
  }

}

[3/23/94 public]
Sent mail to Julie but didn't hear back...
The behavior of this routine is intended to match that of the
Unix getgrnam() library call, which returns only the accounts
listed explicitly in the group entry.
An enhancement request could be filed for a new, distinct API.

[3/24/94 public]
I expected the sec_rgy_unix_getgrnam() API to return all the members I
see when I execute a "view <group> -m" in rgy_edit.  I think it's 
misleading to return only a subset of those members.  I don't understand
the UNIX semantics argument; getgrnam() will return those members visible
in a group entry when you cat /etc/group (regardless of how they got there,
and regardless of whether the group is the member's primary group) -- 
shouldn't sec_rgy_unix_getgrnam() return those members visible when you 
"view -m" the group domain in the registry (regardless of how they got there, 
and regardless of whether the group is the member's primary group)?

[4/1/94 public]
For now, we've agreed to disagree and lower the priority until it's
resolved if the current behavior should be more clearly documented.

[8/9/94 public]
We agree with Rob's statement above and with his side of an email conversation
on this topic between Julie and Rob...  I've reassigned this to doc/millette.

The basic issue is:
(a) Unix getgrname() returns what's in /etc/group
(b) /etc/group is a list of *additional* groups that users are members of,
    *not* necessarily including the group that the account is a primary member
    of (ie: the one listed in /etc/passwd).

(c) The projlist (DCE group list) returned by the security version of getgr*
    is the same as (a) above: those groups where members were specifically
    added (as in (b) above), as opposed to those that are members by virtue
    of assocation by primary group.

We don't agree with JY's argument that since the Unix version returns every-
thing in /etc/group then the DCE version should return everything in the DCE
rgy.  /etc/group is not equivalent to the DCE rgy, it's similar to the explicit
projlists created by explicit member addition to groups in the DCE rgy.

We do agree with the statement that the description of this functionality is
lacking (according to Rob, "the Unix getgrnam() man pages I've checked say
only that it returns an entry of the /etc/group file") and thus this is now
a doc CR to update those manpages.

First there is a documentation error, that we will fix, the parameters
other and cell do not exist in the code!
What you need is self, which can be any principal name that exists in
the cell (currently I am using cell_admin), and for addr you can put
NULL.

Actually it is a little messier than that.  When viewed by Ghostview, or
printed in our environment using the lpr -K2 (print on both sides of the

this problem and were not able to fix it easily.

The man page for sec_login_import_context() reads as follows:

    .... <text deleted> ...
    This routine is generally reserved to the privileged user.

The term "privileged user" is misleading because it leads one 
(at least it led me) that sec_login_import_context() can only
be done by root (on UNIX systems) which is not the case.
(I tend to assosciate a privileged user with root)

I believe the following wording would be clearer:

    .... <text deleted> ....

    To import a login context, a user must have appropriate privileges.

While writing the dce_cf_get_csrgy_filename() man page, I
noticed that the dce_cf pages contained some information
that was inconsistent with other component man pages. I
consulted with Rich Salz - here are the changes that
need to be made:

- remove "Library" section from all dce_cf man pages

- remove "public" on synopsis line from all dce_cf man pages

- add "use lowercase" to input parameters for
    dce_cf_binding_entry_from host()
    dce_cf_prin_name_from_host()
    dce_cf_profile_entry_from_host()

- remove "Note" about case insensitivity from
    dce_cf_binding_entry_from_host()
    dce_cf_find_name_by_key()
    dce_cf_prin_name_from_host()
    dce_cf_profile_entry_from_host()

- remove implementation details from all dce_cf man pages

[9/6/94 public]

Fixed and verified (a while ago) by R. Salz. Note that
CR 11827 means that I had to "undo" the "add 'use lowercase'"
action item in this CR.

  The man page for 'passwd_import' says of the -o switch that is will
cause the named org to be created if it does not exist. The
implementation does not do this, and there is even a functional test
pass that verifies that the missing org is flagged to be missing (an
expected failure case).

If you call xt_test without "-c" in tests.xoms/valid almost all
testcases do fail. If you call it with "-c" all works fine.
The documentation says that it's not necessary to call xt_test in tests.xoms 
with "-xc".

In various places in the Application Development Guide, and
on the rpc intro man page, there appears the following note:

"Note that DCE RPC Version 1.0 supports authenticated RPC
for the connectionless (datagram) protocol only."

This is no longer true so the note needs to be removed.

The affected files are:

/app_ref/man3rpc/intro.3rpc

/app_gd/rpc/1_intro.gpsml
/app_gd/rpc/2_components.gpsml
/app_gd/rpc/5_dce_rpc_ops.gpsml

I was already in there making enhancements.

[08/23/94 public]
Changed priority to "2" and severity to "C".

[9/6/94 public]
Due to reorganization of the RPC chapters of the Application development
Guide, only one of its files needed fixing, the new
app_gd/rpc/basic_tasks.gpsml.

section 29.2.14 Permissionsto Execute sec_admin Subcommands

states that you need 'A" to execute ANY sec_admin subcommands.
This is not true, "A" is required only for commands which modify the
status of the replica (eg. state, delreplica, etc.)

Table 29-2 (pg 29-14) says that the 'A' permission is valid on the
Policy object. There is a good chance that this is no longer true,
and even if it is still allowed, it probably is no longer meaningful.

On the next page, there is acl_edit output which indicates that in the initial
state of a registry database 'A' will be assigned to the Plicy object. The
replist object is not shown. In fact the 'A' will not occur on the policy
objct, but will occur on the replist object.

This CR encompasses all documentation of new dced features for DCE 1.1.

[10/27/94 public]
verified by me and via reviews by John Bowe, Rich Salz, and Ping Wang.

[10/02/95 public]
I am reopening this OT because we never really did have a working
programming example for dced in the 1.1 release.  Before he left
OSF last November, Max Grasso got an example to work; but we didn't
have time to incorporate it into the docset.  This example, plus
accompanying documentation (in ASCII), now sits on Doug Weir's
machine.  

We should decide whether to assign it to HP (who owns dced now),
or have Rosenberry Associates incorporate it (or do nothing with
it).

[10/12/95 public]
I've gotten the little dced-api example Willie mentions above to
build (it didn't before) and run-- almost. I've had to use what I
could still find in the tree as a DCE 1.1 for my 486, and it may be
that the reason why the dce_server_register() call keeps failing
with a "Can't register server with DCE - No permission for name
service operation (dce / rpc)" error, no matter what identity I
run under, has to do with the baseline of DCE 1.1 I'm using, rather
than any fault in the application. I'll try to test this hypothesis
soon by running the program on an HP, if possible. It's hard to see
what could be wrong with the program-- there's so little of it.

[2/27/96 public]
Won't be done for 1.2.1, but still possible for 1.2.2.

[12/14/96 public]

Fixed (with the help of Nick Dokos).

the export tree.  The AUTOGEN pass follows the setup pass and is before 
the EXPORT pass.        

While this is now possible, the question is, should it be left to the
developers to determine what they want exported and make changes 
themselves, should the pass export all *.idl and their generated header
files, or should we come up with a list of the directories to which
particular *.idl and headers get exported?  Keep in mind that by
running the AUTOGEN to pick up *.idl and header files, we may come
across duplicates that will have to be dealt with (ex: rpc/kruntime/ep.acf
and rpc/sys_idl/ep.acf). 

The initial consensus is to use the normal EXPINC (FIRST) pass to do the
primary exporting and then use AUTOGEN for special cases of exporting.
It should be stressed that the AUTOGEN pass is NOT a replacement of the
EXPORT pass, but as a pass to generate and organize files so that
subsequent passes can have needed files in place.

Once policy has been set, a writeup should be sent out to developers and
also placed in some document.

[4/22/94 public]
Using the AUTOGEN (aka SAMIDL) pass.

POLICY: All sams and idl files which produce dependency products (.h or
.idl)
        must use the AUTOGEN pass.

Use AUTOGEN pass for specific needs (ex: when you need .idl and .h
exported).
This is not meant to replace the EXPINC pass, but resolve dependency
issues for these header files specific to idl and sams files.  The AUTOGEN 
pass follows the SETUP pass and runs before the EXPORT pass.

While other possible options are possible, they require a lot (2+ weeks) of

work, which is a luxury neither OSF, Provider, and RAT engineers currently
have.  This approach will resolve the immediate dependency problems and
take little work to impliment.  Engineers can add further .idl and .h files

directly to the AUTOGEN pass.  This may change the policy eventually to an 
AUTOGEN pass that exports all sams and idl stuff, although this is not 
likely to happen in the time frame of DCE1.1.

We have a very complex set of build dependencies involving idl files and 
their subsequent code generated probucts:  headers, and stubs -- both 
source code and object module format.  We seem to be getting into the same 
sort of dependency problem with sams files.

Note - the following constraints were considered:
        - the time remaining on the DCE1.1 project
        - the work load of OSF, Providers, and RAT engineering cycles
        - avoid violating the assignment of build operation->pass

Example: To use the AUTOGEN pass

        - place your directory in the SAMIDL_SUBDIRS in each Makefile
          until you get to the directory needed.  For example, you need
          to use the AUTOGEN pass for the directory/gds/sams directory,
          do the following:

                top-level Makefile: SAMIDL_SUBDIRS = directory
                directory Makefile: SAMIDL_SUBDIRS = gds
                gds Makefile: SAMIDL_SUBDIRS = sams

                *Note: ensure you place the directory name in the order
                       in which you need the files.
          
Below is a preliminary writeup on this for the "DCE Porting and Testing
Guide".

                           AUTOGEN/SAMIDL pass
                           -------------------

10.1.3 Organization of the DCE Build Process

* AUTOGEN

  This pass builds sams and idl related files.  They can also be exported.
  You can generate header files from *.idl files and export them so that
  other components, have the required dependent *.idl or header file.

10.1.4.2 Subdirectory Variables

* SAMIDL_SUBDIRS

  Defines a list of subdirectories to visit during the autogen pass.  
  This pass is used to build sams, *.idl, header, *cstubs.c, *stubs.c, 
  *cstubs.o, and *stubs.o files in the obj tree.

10.1.4.3a ODE Variables Used in the AUTOGEN Pass

The following variables are used by ODE during the autogen pass to 
determine various targets and dependencies.  The goal of the autogen 
pass to to build sams files and place any *.idl and header dependency
needed by other components into the export tree or obj tree.

* SAMIDL_INCLUDES

  Defines a list of files (*.idl and *.h) to be exported.  This 
   should only be used for those files generated in the AUTOGEN pass. 

* IDLFILES

  Defines a list of *.idl files to run the idl compiler on

* SAMSFILES

  Defines a list of *.sams files to run the sams compiler on.

* SAMS_TARGETS

  Defines a list of files to be generated from the ${SAMFILES} and 
  placed in the obj tree.

  For example:  the dcp.sams file, SAMS_TARGETS might be set
                to the following: dcedcpsvc.h dcedcpmsg.h dcedcpmac.h
                                  dcedcpsvc.c dcedcpmsg.c dcedcp.cat

* SAMS_SCRIPTS

  Defines a list of sams scripts to be built during the autogen pass.
 
* SAMS_OTHERS

  Defines a list of other things to be built during the autogen pass.

* SAMSFLAG

  Defines a list of flags to pass to the sams compiler.

The discussion of the param "principal_name" in the
sec_key_mgmt_initialize_cursor() manapage is wrong.  It says now:

	A pointer to a character string indicating the name
	of the principal whose key is to be changed.

sec_key_mgmt_initialize_cursor() is also used if you want to reall all
keys, without changing them.  There should also be a discussion for
specifying NULL for this param, which is used when accessing all keys,
not just for a single prin.

[1/19/94 public]
I'm entering this to get more info, this might very well turn out to be a
doc bug, stay a code bug, or be cancelled.

We've found that sec_rgy_site_open() accepts various forms of input, either
a string binding, a cell name, or the name of a server entry to import
from.  All of the above are documented in the reference page.

We've also found that if you give a cellname followed by garbage, you bind
to the cell name.  So binding to "/.../real_cell/badname" results in a
binding to a secd in /.../real_cell, even though there is no entry called
badname. 

I've been trying to track down what would happen if you appended a garbage
name to a valid server entry name.  Would it bind to the server entry or to
the cell name?  I don't know.

Some here have suggested that this behavior is probably a bug in
sec_rgy_site_open and if you give it extra garbage an error should be
generated.  I've found the following in
security/client/rca/internal_binding.c in the routine rca_site_bind_nsi():

    /* attempt to import a sec_rgy binding handle from this name */
    if (STATUS_EQUAL(status, rpc_s_partial_results)) 
	/* keep going in order to accept principal names; revisit someday */;
    else if (BAD_STATUS(status)) 
    {
	SEC_DBG_GPRINTF(("(rca_site_bind_nsi) inq_resolution failed, status %x\n", *status));
	return false;    
    }

    rpc_ns_binding_import_begin(rpc_c_ns_syntax_dce, 
	context->site_name,
	context->if_spec, (uuid_p_t)NULL,
	&context->import_handle, status);
 
So I get the impression that the behavior is desired from the comment (but
when is someday? :-).  If so then it should be documented.  If not, then
the code should be changed.  What's the story?

[ mob 7/21/94 public ]

this do doc/millette.

The routine dce_cf_get_csrgy_filename() needs to be documented
in the Application Development Reference for DCE 1.1. This fact
was initially reported in CR9668. I opened a new CR for this
man page because I am responsible for documenting the code
set registry, and have also been assigned to document this
routine (since it's related to the code set registry).

If there needs to be any guide information about this routine
in the dced documentation, I'll coordinate the work with John.

[2/17/94 public]

Submitted new dce_cf_get_csrgy_filename.3dce man page to

[1/11/94 public]

In the 1.0.2 Admin Ref, the page on sec_login_get_expiration gives
incomplete information on the semantics of the output parameter
identity_expiration.  Technically its type is signed32, so then the
question is okay how do I use it?  As near as I can tell, this 
parameter is copied  from a sec_timeval_sec_t value, which means that
it is interpreted the same way as a Unix time_t value - as the number
of seconds since epoch.  So now I can use it in expressions with Unix
time values, like what I get back from time().

It's obvious, but maybe it should be made more obvious.

A discussion between Nita Sims of HaL Computers and Mark Carter
of U Michigan on dce-talk uncovered an error in the UUID description
in Section 28.4.1 "adopt Syntax". The UUID format is incorrectly 
described and illustrated as an 8-4-4-12 hex digit string.
It is actually an 8-4-4-4-12 string.

This error also appears in the Administration Reference in
the rgy_edit man page, in the description of the "adopt"
subcommand. (There are also several typos on the spelling
of "organization" within this section).

The affected files are:

/admin_ref/man8sec/rgy_edit.8sec
/admin_gd/security/security/12_trouble.gpsml

Section 4.3.1 "Invoking the acl_edit Command" in the User's Guide mentions
that if you invoke acl_edit without the -ngui switch it will come up in a
GUI if the terminal is capable of that.  Table 4-2 mentions it too.

It is true that acl_edit takes a -ngui switch, but no GUI mode is
implemented in the code as shipped by OSF.  If you invoke acl_edit on an
xterm without -ngui, you still get the command-line interface.

This section should be changed to say that if your version of acl_edit
supports a GUI and your terminal is capable of using it, invoking acl_edit
without any switches will bring up the GUI mode.  Use the -ngui switch to
bring up the command-line mode.  The examples in this chapter assume that
acl_edit does not have a GUI mode; i.e., no examples specify the use of
-ngui and all assume a command-line interface.

[12/23/93 public]

The current plan for DCE 1.1 is to eliminate the guide
descriptions of acl_edit (and other control programs
whose functions dcecp will perform) and replace them
with descriptions of dcecp functions for manipulating
ACLs. Under this plan, there is no need to revise
the acl_edit documentation in the User's Guide as Howard
has suggested since it's going to be thrown away.

However, it seems to make sense to add a clarifying
sentence about the presence of GUIs and using -ngui
to the reference description of acl_edit (i.e., add the
information to the description of the -gui switch on the
acl_edit man page). 

I'm assigning this CR to Pam Millett (security doc owner).

In the User's Guide in section 4.2.3 "Acl Entry Types for Dissimila DCE
Releases" there is a reference that says (See section 4.7 for information
on how to use assign).  Section 4.7 does not describe the assign command.
Section 4.5.2 does.

[2/28/94 public]

Because dcecp will be able to perform the function that the
acl_edit assign subcommand performs, Section 4.5.2 in the
User's Guide will be deleted. Instead, the Administration Guide
documentation for dcecp will contain a section that describes
how to use it to do the acl_edit assign function (see CR9637).
Once the dcecp writer (Ward Rosenberry) has decided where
in the Administration Guide the information will appear
about using this dcecp functionality, he should add
the appropriate pointer to this "ACL Entry Types for
Dissimilar DCE Releases" section (which will also be in
the Administration Guide, since the User's Guide and
Reference is being eliminated for DCE 1.1). Assigning
this CR to Ward Rosenberry (OSF dcecp writer).

[10/05/94 public]

This section with the bad reverence moved into the Admin Gd core volume

I discovered that the Intro to DCE is including the glossary (.gL)
directives twice.  These are all in the file intro/intro/3p_glossary.gpsml.
This file is included once (via .dI) in the file 3_tech.gpsml and again in
the file gl_title.gpsml.  Apparently the intention is that they should be
included in gl_title.gpsml.  Therefore, the line
".dI intro/3p_glossary.gpsml" should be removed from 3_tech.gpsml.

At least two PostScript files in the Administration Guide--Core Components
are being truncated when printed: 1_over.ps and 13_access.ps.  The reason
is that these files contain included PostScript figures whose prologs
contain too many definitions.  The workaround is to edit the PostScript
file for each included figure.  The files in question are
admin_gd/security/security/figures/*.ps.  For each file to be fixed, add
the following two lines somewhere *after* the first line (which starts with
%!) but *before* the first definition in the prolog:

/tempdict 300 dict def
tempdict begin

I suggest putting these immediately after the %%EndComments line.

Then, add the following line at the end of the file:

end % tempdict

It would be good to check other included PostScript figures for this
problem.

[4/5/94 public]

I have applied this fix to all PostScript files in the doc tree that are
known to have this problem.  These include all files created with Interleaf
or IslandDraw.  The affected files are listed above.

I am changing the status to "fix" rather than "closed" because someone
should try to verify near the end of the release cycle that no other
PostScript files cause this problem.  Unfortunately, the only way to verify
the fix exhaustively is to print out all chapters that contain PostScript
figures.  In lieu of that, perhaps someone could do some sampling.

[08/25/94 public]
Reassigned to Doc Manager Hal Lichtin at his request.
He'll decide who will verify and close this CR closer to
the end of the project.

[10/26/94 public]

I am keeping this open and defering it to 1.2 for two reasons: First, there
are illustrations in chapters 33 and 41 of the Administration Guide -- Core
Services that print correctly in some circumstances but not in others; this
needs to be fixed.  Second, the process of reviewing and fixing printout of
PostScript Figures will be required for EACH and EVERY RELEASE.

I am closing CR 10055 and moving the following information from that CR
to this one:

  The changes made to the figures listed in this CR (the figures in
  admin_gd/security/security/5_multicell.gpsml) appear to have caused some
  formatting problems in this chapter.  Figures seem to be floating out of
  their allotted regions.  Formatted output should be checked and necessary
  figure box parameter adjustments made.

  [hal 10/25/94 public]
  Actually it is a little messier than that.  When viewed by Ghostview, or
  printed in our environment using the lpr -K2 (print on both sides of the
  paper) option, there are the problems described above.  If we print the 
  chapter using only one side of the paper, it prints fine.  We looked at
  this problem and were not able to fix it easily.

  [millette 10/26/94 public]
  These files print with no problems at HP.  I used the standard 
  placement procedure (from rom) that worked for all previous Security 
  files.  The only difference is that previous Security ps files were 
  derived from Interleaf files;  These files were derived from Frame 
  files.

Two new chapters have been created that are currently labelled: 10a_encode.gpsml and 10b_ichar_support.gpsml. The new chapters describe the IDL Encoding Services and Support for International Characters respectively. These chapters might have to be renumbered so that they conform to the current numbering scheme in the Application Development Guide.

In 18.1.5 (pg. 18-8) of the admin guide it is stated that:
	When the Cache Manager traverses a pathname to locate
	a file, it begins at the top-level fileset in your cell
	and accesses the read-only versions of filesets whenever
	possible. However, if any fileset in the pathname has no
	read-only versions, the Cache Manager accesses the read-write
	version and never accesses a read-only version for as long as it
	traverses the remainder of the path.
This is not correct and in direct contradiction with 18.6.1.1 (pg. 18-44):
	When a moint point names a fileset with a .readonly or .backup
	extension, the Cache Manager uses only the specified fileset.
	The Cache Manager never accesses the read-write version of a
	fileset when it encounters a mount point that names a read-only
	or backup version;

Actually, this sounds correct.  Section 18.1.5 is talking about
the traversal of regular mount points and the bias in the cache
manager toward a R/O fileset if it exists.  Section 18.6.1.1 is
talking about creating an explicit mount point for the .backup or
.readonly (instead of a regular mount point for the R/W as in 18.1.5).
For example, if root.dfs is replicated then access to /.:/fs will
always go to the R/O.  However if an explicit mount point exists,
say /.:/fs/u/dstokes/root.dfs which was created by:
fts crm /.:/fs/u/dstokes/root.dfs root.dfs.readonly
then there is no decision to be made on the part of the cache
manager, it always goes directly to the readonly regardless
of what the parent directory was.

[5/19/94 public]

rpc_binding_set_auth_info.3rpc has bad prototype for the server_princ_name
arg.  It says 2 start.  Should be just one.  (There's a comment in there
that asks if this is correct.)

[2/1/94 public]

Made this easy change to the man page and marked
the CR verified. (Note: the current RPC AES shows the
correct synopsis).

[2/15/94]

Forgot to mark it verified and add "fixed in" field.

the commands 'set lan timeout' and 'set wan timeout' are not documented.

[11/19/93 public]
They should be documented as:

	set lan timeout == set local set timeout
	set wan timeout == set global set timeout

[1/18/94 public]

The set(8dts) man page in the DCE Administration Reference
describes set local set timeout and set global set timeout.

Section 15.4.1.7 in the DCE Administration Guide also
explains set local set timeout/set global set timeout.

Consequently, I am cancelling this CR.

[01/18/94 public]
You shouldn't cancel this, you should document that 'lan' and 'wan' timeout
are the same as local/global set timeout.

[3/29/94 public]

Reassigning this CR to Peter Neilson (OSF dts writer). Discussed
this CR with Hal and Tom, and the fix is as Tom says...to add
a note to the set(8dts) that says set lan timeout is same as
set local set timeout and set wan timeout is the same as
set global set timeout. (The 'set lan/wan timeout' commands
are obsolete dtscp commands that still exist in DCE code).

This is my fault. This has been fixed in both the Admin Guide (see

Assuming that the documentation is correct,  the rgy_edit -l flag
does not work.

The admin reference man page for rgy_edit lists the -l flag to be used
to edit or to view entries in the local registry. The Admin Guide uses the 
-l flag to edit local registry entries (see sections 17.9, 20.9, and 
20.9.3). However, the current implementation of rgy_edit does not seem
to recognize this flag, unless one is doing help, lifespan, and quit. 
Here is an example:


Build: Nov 6, 1993

Cell:  HP 	DCE server
       HP	DCE client
      486	DCE client and SEC replica


root@largo> rgy_edit -l
rgy_edit=> do p
Unknown command: do
rgy_edit=>  domain org
Unknown command: domain
rgy_edit=> v
?(rgy_edit) Unable to view local registry entries - cannot find local registry (dce / sec)
rgy_edit=> prop
?(rgy_edit) Unable to read local registry property record - cannot find local registry (dce / sec)
rgy_edit=> help
Known commands are:
        d[elete]        e[xit]          h[elp]          lifespan        
        pr[operties]    pu[rge]         q[uit]          v[iew]          
rgy_edit=> lifespan

(It works)

rgy_edit=> quit
bye.

The Admin Guide says that the following subset of rgy-edit 
commands can be used with rgy_edit -l:

view
delete principal
properties
help

In addition to the above commands, the rgy-edit command provides one
additional subcommand purge, and an additional regstry property, called
the registry capacity....

This does not work either.

root@largo> rgy_edit -l
rgy_edit=> purge
**** Assertion warning. attempt to release mutex owned by another thread
     at line 2624 in /project/dce/build/dce1.0.3-snap/src/threads/cma_pthread.c 
?(rgy_edit) Unable to purge expired local registry entries - cannot find local registry (dce / sec)

[11/8/93 public]
Never assume anything :-)
The documentation may not say it, but the rgy_edit -l commands can only
succeed if there is a local registry available, and there is only a local
registry available if users have logged into that machine with either a
correctly integrated /bin/login (or X based login) or dce_login with the -c
(certify) option.  Changed to a 'doc' CR.

[11/8/93 public]

First, doing a dce_login -c gives the following messages - I don't think
they should be there. 

root@largo> dce_login -c
Enter Principal Name: cell_admin
Enter Password: 
**** Assertion warning. attempt to release mutex owned by another thread
     at line 2624 in /project/dce/build/dce1.0.3-snap/src/threads/cma_pthread.c 
**** Assertion warning. attempt to release mutex owned by another thread
     at line 2624 in /project/dce/build/dce1.0.3-snap/src/threads/cma_pthread.c 
Password must be changed!
root@largo>

Second, the purge and delete command under rgy_edit -l gives the same warning:

rgy_edit=> purge
**** Assertion warning. attempt to release mutex owned by another thread
     at line 2624 in /project/dce/build/dce1.0.3-snap/src/threads/cma_pthread.c 

0 account entries purged
0 TGT entries purged


It does not seem to be only a documentation problem.

[11/3/93 public]
If you are seeing assertion warnings when trying to do a dce_login (with the
latest 1.0.3 bits) then open an A0 CR ASAP, and let Bob Hathaway know you may
have found a showstopper.

[11/9/93 public]
I've downgraded this CR's severity and priority.  Basically, the 
documentation is correct; however it might be helpful to add 
something about the local registry being created only if you did correct dce_login 
not just local login.  We might also add that if there is 
no local registry because of above reason, user will get an error.
I've also changed to fix by to 1.1.  A separate CR(9407) has been opened 
for the assertion errors, which are a code, not documentation problem.

[6/21/94 public]
Fixed and verified.  Verified by me.

The description of the first parameter (a handle_t) of all the rdacl_XXX()
calls (in 3sec) is incorrect.  The text says
    A handle referring to the target object.  Use sec_acl_bind()
    to create this handle.

This should say that it's the binding handle returned by some 
rpc_ns_binding* call.  (It looks like this text was just copied from
the sec_acl_XXX calls.)

Somewhere in the documentation of dts server behavior (perhaps in 13.3.2.3
or 15.4.1.1 or maybe in the admin ref. -- 1.0.2 doc) it should be mentioned
that a courier will try to synchronize with a global server if one is
available but that if none is: it will synchronize with local servers
provided enough are available to satisfy the "servers required" attribute
and increase the "no global server detected" count.

"We have several minor comments on the Porting Guide's DTS chapter we'd
 like to pass along:

 1. In section 6.2, under para. heading "Modify byte-order info.",
        there is no file utctime.h as indicated. It is added under
        machine-dept. directories.

 2. at the end of section 6.2, the machine/utctime.h file is incorrectly
        cited as containing MAXDRIFTRECIP. It is found in
        kern_utctime.c in the reference sources.

The following is the output of sec_admin, in DCE 1.0.3, after being
invoked:

root@trinidad> sec_admin 
Default replica:  /.../admin_cell/subsys/dce/sec/bronze
Default cell:     /.../admin_cell


The admin guide shows the following output:

root@trinidad> sec_admin 
Default cell:     /.../admin_cell
Default replica:  /.../admin_cell/subsys/dce/sec/bronze
State: in service slave


Two things:

First,  the order of the first two lines is reversed.
Second, the third line is not displayed by current implementation - although
        it would be nice.


Whether the documentation is correct and the code deviated, I do not know.

[11/3/93 public]

Assigned this CR to Pam Millett and changed "fixby"
date to 1.1 per doc group (Hal Lichtin) policy 
(defer bugs filed after 1.0.3 soft freeze date).

[11/5/93 public]

This is also true of the sec_admin man page. See
admin_ref/man8sec/sec_admin.8sec

[11/9/93 public]

One more note on the output of sec_admin. The documentation, admin guide
and admin reference, is pretty consistent showing the expected output 
from sec_admin. What it seems to have happened is that at some point the
sec_admin code diverged from the documentation and changed the ouput.  

In my opinion the documentation makes more sense.  The code 
should be changed to reflect what has been documented; and remain 
faithful to it. Whether the code or the docs need to change to resolve
their discrepancies is not for someone else (at HP) to decide.

[11/8/93 public]
The documentation was written before sec_admin was implemented because of
documentation schedules that were not synchronized with our implementation
schedules.  The utility is correct and the documentation needs to be brought
up to date.

The example for ktadd in the OSF Admin Guide (Revision 1.0,Update 1.0.1,
July 1992) on page 4-15, section 4.7.1.4 shown below is incorrect :

     rgy_edit=> ktadd -p random_note_generation -f /dresden/srv_key -r

If a server does an

and a client does NOT do any rpc_binding_set_auth_info() (say, the
client might not even have done a dce_login), then what happens when the

All existing documentation (App Dev Gd, App Dev Ref, RPC AES, Ed

the former happens, but some code experimentation (as well as some

The manager wakes up, and it is up to it, to decide what to do based
on what the client did.  If it was rejected in the runtime, then an
unauthenticated call would never get to authenticated servers (ie: secd
and cdsd) and there would be no need for the "unauthenticated" ACL
entry type (that's not the reason itself, but it does show one argument
for the design).

Mike is right.  In the original design, we had allowed the server to assert
a "minimum" security level, and the runtime would not invoke the manager
functions unless the security attributes exceeded the minimum.  This was
dropped eventually due to complaints from the RPC folks (primarily steve
miller of DEC I believe.  Their argument was that you could accomplish this
in the manager functions, so why add it to the basic suite of RPC stuff.)

Like I said, all this make eminently good sense when one thinks about
it, it's just too bad that "nobody" knows it (in the sense of all
documentation being written incorrectly and not reviewed well enough)
...

BTW, I assume there are *some* circumstances where the RPC gets rejected
by the runtime, such as when the server registers DES and the client
sends RSA ...

[11/12/93 Public]

writer is already assigned to the bug, but I formally assigned it to ensure
it is tracked properly.

[11/12/93 Public]

The solution for this problem will be to provide a
clarifying note for the 1.0.3 release notes, and then really deal
with this in the 1.1 docs., as part of a deep housecleaning of the
security documentation.  The clarifying note text is as follows:
-------------------------- cut here -----------------------------
The \*LDCE Application Development Guide\*O and \*LDCE Application
Development Reference\*O may be misleading about
what happens when an unauthenticated client calls a server that has
specified authentication.  In such a case, the RPC runtime will not
perform any authentication, and \*Ethe call will reach the application
manager code\*O.  It is up to the manager to decide how to deal with
the unauthenticated call.  
.P
Typically, servers and clients establish authentication as follows:
.ML
.LI
The server specifies an authentication service for a principal
identity under which it runs by calling
\*Lrpc_server_register_auth_info(\|)\*O.  The authentication service
is specified by the \*Vauthn_svc\*O parameter of this call.
Currently, servers may specify either DCE secret key authentication
(by supplying either \*Lrpc_c_authn_dce_secret\*O or
\*Lrpc_c_authn_default\*O) or no authentication (by supplying
\*Lrpc_c_authn_none\*O).  The specified authentication service will be
used \*Eif it is also requested by the client\*O.  
.LI
The client sets authentication for a binding handle by calling
\*Lrpc_binding_set_auth_info(\|)\*O.  The choices are also currently
either DCE secret key or no authentication.  Client calls made on the 
binding handle attempt to use the specified authentication service.
.LI
The server manager code calls \*Lrpc_binding_inq_auth_client(\|)\*O to
extract any auth information from the client binding for the call.
.LE
.P
Whether the call actually wakes up in the server manager code or is
rejected by the runtime depends on following conditions:
.ML
.LI
If the client specified no authentication, then none is attempted by
the RPC runtime.  The call wakes up in the manager code whether the
server specified authentication or not.  This permits both
authenticated and unauthenticated clients to call authenticated
servers.  When the manager receives an unauthenticated call, it needs
to make a decision about how to proceed.
.LI
If the client specified DCE secret key authentication and the server
specified no authentication, then the runtime will fail the call, and
it will never reach the manager routine.
.LI
If both client and server specified DCE secret key authentication,
then authentication will be carried out by the RPC runtime
transparently.  Whether the call reaches the server manager code or is
rejected by the runtime depends on whether the authentication
succeeded.
.LE
.P
Although the RPC runtime is responsible any authentication that is
carried out, the fact that the runtime will always permit
unauthenticated clients to reach the manager code means that a manager
access function typically does need to make an authentication check.
When the manager access routine calls 
\*Lrpc_binding_inq_auth_client(\|)\*O it needs to check for a
\*Vstatus\*O of \*Lrpc_s_binding_has_no_auth\*O.  In this case, the
client has specified no authentication and the manager access function
needs to make an access decision based on this fact. Note that in such
a case, no meaningful authentication or authorization information is
returned from \*Lrpc_binding_inq_auth_client(\|)\*O.

Reassigned this CR to John Shirley (OSF RPC writer) from
Steve Lewontin.

[11/12/93 public]

This item is in the Release Notes, in the State of the DCE Documentation section,
under Application Guide, near the end of Chapter 1.

[08/09/94 public]
Reassigned to myself.

[08/23/94 public]
Changed priority to "1" and severity to "B".

[09/15/94 public]
Fixed and verified by Walt Tuvell.

Added a clear pointer to doc for RPC routines that directly
relate to security issues in the file
app_gd/security/1_overv.gpsml

Added the Release Notes overview of the way that servers and
clients establish authentication to the file
app_gd/rpc/rpc_and_dce.gpsml

Added the Release Notes description of conditions affecting
the outcome of the client/server interaction to the file
app_ref/man3rpc/rpc_binding_set_auth_info.3rpc

A "deep housecleaning" of the security documentation is not
possible at this point.  But, this 1.0.3 Release Notes information
has been incorporated into the DCE doc set, and the necessary
pointers have been added.

[10/20/94 public]
Closed bug.

[10/22/93 public]
We are adding a new option to the "dfsd" command in 1.0.3a, so
we'll need to document it.
The syntax of the new option is
dfsd -namecachesize <number of entries>
<number of entries> is required should be a number greater than zero.
The default value is 256.
Description:
This option allows one to configure the number
of entries allocated for DFS cache manager's name lookup cache.
The purpose of the name lookup cache is to store the results 
obtained from remote diretory lookup requests to DFS servers.
This allows subsequent lookup requests for that same file
or directory to be satisfied locally on the DFS client, rather 
than remotely on the DFS server.  Of course, since the 
cache entries are eventually recycled, the ability to satisfy
the request locally is dependent on the size of the cache. 
The default size of the caches is 256 entries.

[10/22/93 public]
I believe that information about this new option needs
to be added to the Administration Guide, Chapter 8,
"Configuring the Cache Manager" as well as to the
reference page on dfsd. It's not currently clear to
me which section in this chapter should contain the information,
so I'll consult with Diane Delgado to find out.

[10/22/93 public]
No information about the proposed new option needs to be included in the file
8_cachemgr_dfs.gpsml.  The only references to this functionality should be on
the dfsd.8dfs manpage.  Inclusion of this information in the DFS chapters of
the DCE Admin Guide would probably necessitate the addition of a whole new
section to discuss the name lookup cache.  Such information would do nothing
but obfuscate an already confusing chapter.  (Note that there are ample
precedents for not including this material in the DCE Admin Guide, as many
existing options of the overburdened dfsd command are not currently documented
in the guide.)
 
The priority of this change needs to be elevated; once the related code
enhancement is made, this is a required interface change.  The code and doc
need to match.

[11/3/93 public]

Fixed dfsd.8dfs man page to include new option. Diane
Delgado verified. Will close this bug and open a new
CR (a 1.1 enhancement request) which suggests that the
Administration Guide cache manager chapter be improved
to include lookup cache info and to be less confusing.

In the porting and testing guide, on page 6.17 under section 6.4.4
API Tests, there is a note about the daylight savings time switch 
in October 1974.  The code has been changed to have an ifdef to
control wheather this bug is worked around in the test.

It is called NOV1974_BUG, and is actually defined for all three
of the reference platforms in <TARGET_OS>/osdep.mk.

Basically, the last sentence in the note should refer to NOV1974_BUG
instead of _AIX.

Also note that the rantest_api program takes in a argument.  I believe
this change has already been made, I know there is another bug about it.

Section 6.4.6 of the Porting and testing guide needs a reworking
to describe the improved functional test for dtscp.

There is now a script which run dtscp commands and compares the
output to an expected results file.  Thus the tester doesn't have
to examine to output by hand to verify that the test worked.

There are two scripts and two expected results templates 
in src/test/time/control:
	test_dtscp.ksh
	dtscp.ksh
	test_dtscp_clerk.templ
	test_dtscp_server.templ

The script to run is test_dtscp.ksh (notice the extra 's' is gone 
from the name).  This script takes one arguement, 'server' or 'clerk',
depending on what type of DTS machine you are running.

It then edits the template files with local information such
as the hostname, clock adjustment rate, and the next TDF change.
This gets placed in test_dtscp_{clerk|server}.exp.
The actual results of running the test (the dtscp.ksh script) are
placed in test_dtscp.act.

After the script is run, it reports if the expected matches the actual
output, and puts any differences in test_dtscp.diff.
Test_dtscp.ksh will also test commands which have variable output
(such as the current time) and report any failures.

It should be noted that the server test should be run with a server that
has just been started, with no time provider, in a cell with no 
other dts servers.

The clerk test should be run with a clerk that has just been started,
in a cell with no GLOBAL servers and at least one local server.

Also note that these test turn on and off the DTS trace facility,
so there may be trace output on the tty which dtsd was start from.

Sample output from a clerk test:
# ./test_dtscp.ksh clerk
START DCE time functional test: dtscp.ksh; DATE: Thu Oct 21 11:53:41 EDT 1993
The value of NODE_TYPE is clerk
Begin test of dtscp command structure (Thu Oct 21 11:53:43 EDT 1993)
You are running this test on a dts clerk (right?)
Actual output is in file test_dtscp.act
Expected output is in file test_dtscp_clerk.exp
Compare actual output to expected output
Actual output matches expected output
Execute variable commands
PASSED, Test 1 "TEST_DTSCP" : test ran successfully
END DCE time functional test: dtscp.ksh; DATE: Thu Oct 21 11:59:16 EDT 1993

Sample output from a server test:
START DCE time functional test: dtscp.ksh; DATE: Thu Oct 21 12:10:39 EDT 1993
The value of NODE_TYPE is server
Begin test of dtscp command structure (Thu Oct 21 12:10:42 EDT 1993)

Expected output is in file test_dtscp_server.exp

DCE 1.0.2 Admin Guide - Part 4 - Chapter 17.

The following paragragh in section 17.3 needs to be rewritten, it is
not clear.

   Although there is no relationship required between a principal's logical
   identy and any object in the name space, frequently just such a
   relationship may be desired and can be enforced.  In the Security 
   Service there is a corresponding object in the requistry database 
   for each principal name. The database object, which is created
   autimatically when a principal is created, contains attributes of the
   principal, such as account information.

The description of timop in Chapter 3 of the Application has to be revised
and updated. In particular, a detailed list of the steps necessary for installing
timop should be added to the introductory text section of this chapter.

[11/2/93 public]

This is all done. I updated the build procedure, and added a new section
with the installation steps supplied by Nick Dokos. I also updated the
README that accompanies the timop sources. Tested on the HP, 486, and AIX
platforms.

The permission and ownership checks made by the bosserver for certain
installation directories are only vendor-configurable defaults.  We need to
include a note to this extent in the documentation.

The fts rmsite command (as of code defect 8043) can remove a replication site
from a detached aggregate provided the user specifies the aggregate ID of the
detached aggregate with the -aggregate option.  This needs to be mentioned in

The documentation needs to mention the maximum number of read-only replicas
that can be created of any fileset.  It also needs to discuss some factors,
such as site (server/aggregate) placement, that can affect how many replicas
are possible.

In section 5.5.2 of the Porting Guide, 'Setting Up for Administration
Tests.'

It is unclear that the files referred to in step 12 are the products of
step 11.  These files are CACHE-DATABASE3, CACHE-DATABASE4,
CACHE-DATABASE1.

It is also unclear in step 12 that TEST3-DATABASE1, TEST4-DATABASE1, and
TEST4-CHANGEDB1 are files that have to be saved, as well.

(Basically, step 11 explains how to save GDS cache information.  Step 12
assumes that you have called your saved files specific things.)

The show man page for dtscp is incorrect in it's description of status.
The begining of the page says you can do:

	show all
	show all characteristics
	show all counters
	show all status
	show global servers
	show local servers

You can also do

	show current time

The description of the status' lists several things as being displayed
including current time, global servers, local servers.  None of these are
displayed when show all status is entered.  They are only displayed when
the individual commands

	show current time
	show global servers
	show local servers

are entered.

Also, there is a formatting error for the uid status.  It's listed as a
value of the state status, it really is it's own status  (in other words,
end the state list before the uid list item).  I think there is already a
bug opened for this one small point.

[10/5/93 public]
Actually this man page is really bad.  It seems the show command provides
different output if on a clerk or a server.  I don't know if there is any
difference if run on a local or global server or a courier.  Someone really
has to go through running the commands and seeing what the output is.  The
man page must indicate which characteristics/counters/status values are
only shown on a server.

In my runs, I found two counters that I don't see documented:

  Local server not in group
  Servers not in group

Here are the results of some of my test runs.  First on a clerk then on a
server:

And just for grins, I'll add, that all descriptions of attributes should

	clock adjustment rate      is nsec/sec
        maximum clock drift rate   is nsec/sec
        clock resolution	   is nsec/sec

These might be the only three that are missing.

In consultation with Howard Melman, we determined that most of the work
suggested above had already by been done by me for verifying other bugs.
So, most issues had already been reflected in the documentation.

What was added for CR9002 were clear explanations of server-only
output for both the show.8tds reference page of the admin_ref, and the
3_managing_dts.gpsml file of the admin_gd.

Howard Melman approved all changes.

When using the ksh shell you cannot execute shell scripts from DFS.
 
To recreate the problem:
 
cd /.:/fs
create shell script as follows
 
------------------------cut here----------------------------------
#!/bin/ksh
 
echo "It worked"
------------------------cut here----------------------------------
 
execute ksh foo and it works
chmod a+x foo
execute ./foo and you get "ksh: /././foo: cannot open"
 
This appears to be another problem with using the ":" character in your
path name.  It has also broken make from working without symbolic links.

[9/27/93 public]
Is there really any reason for this to be considered a DFS bug?
Looks like DCE to me.

Changing to doc bug to document this restriction.  Changing area
to dce.

[10/13/93 public]
Walt and I would like a little more description here.  For example, does
the same thing occur in sh or csh?  Can you describe the make problems more
fully, and example would help.
 
We know that you can't put a /.: in your $PATH, but I'm not sure that this
is what this bug is about.  If it's something else, it could be a new
restriction that we hadn't thought of.

[10/13/93 public]
The problem as stated looks like a ksh problem; do we have any access to
problem-reporting channels for ksh?
Replacing ``ksh'' with ``sh'' or ``csh'' makes the problem go away.
With the original ksh script, when I use /: instead of /.: I get:
	# cd /:
	# ./foo
	/bin/ksh: //./foo: cannot open
	# echo $cwd
	/:
	# pwd
	/.../thunk.dce.transarc.com/fs
	# cd `pwd`
	# ./foo
	It worked
 
It appears that ksh (not sh or csh) has a problem with ':' in the $PWD
environment variable when it starts up.  Perhaps it's trying to canonicalize
the path to the program being executed, truncates the name in $PWD at its
first colon, then appends the named executable to it:
	(colon-truncate("/:") -> "/") CAT "/" CAT "./foo" = "//./foo"
	(colon-truncate("/.:/fs") -> "/") CAT "/" CAT "./foo" = "/././foo"
 
As to the Make problems, I have no idea.

[10/13/93 public]

When I was the Tech Lead for the AIX Reference Platform during DCE 1.0.1
integration we attempted to build DCE from DFS where the backing tree was
in one fileset and the sandbox was in another fileset.  We tried to use
ODE but make kept failing because the ODE version of make uses a ":" as
a field seperator for it's VPATH variable.  We finally had to create a
symbolic link to the /.:/fs directory before we could build.  

This is not the only case where this is a problem.  The "ksh" problem 
just came up lately with a customer that is attempting to use DFS.  We
tried to prevent the use of ":" in the DCE namespace during the earlier
naming discussions but were overridden by the OSF.

Now my customer wants to know why we use ":" in the DCE paths when it
causes these types of problems and restrictions.

Jim

[10/13/93 public]

I gather that by re-assigning this as a doc bug to document a restriction
then we are to tell the customer that they should not use the recommended
path's to the DFS namespace if they are going to use either "ksh" or "make"
from the DFS namespace.  

These programs seem to be more widely used than DCE is at the moment and
I think it would be harder to change the architecture of ksh and make
than it would be to change the DCE architecture.

Jim

[10/13/93 public]
changed to code bug.  Let's solve the code problem before figuring out what
we have to document.

[10/15/93 public]
Changed back to a doc bug for 1.0.3.  We are not going to change the 1.0.3
code as the freeze is today.  The 1.0.3 Release Notes (?) should mention
that we have seen some problems with ksh and make when run in DFS, and
suggest work-arounds (if we have them).  I'll open a separate 1.1 bug to
look into if we need to change something in the code to address these
problems.   Doug, if you need more information than is in this CR I suggest
you talk to Jim Wade directly for an explanantion of the problem.

The adopt command in rgy_edit.8sec could use a better description.

It should be spelled out clearly that the name given must be a new pgo name
and that an existing name cannot be used.  Both Gail and I thought this at
first (probably due to the word adopt) and nothing in the doc told us this
wasn't possible.

The last paragraph of the adopt command is too weak.  The description of
the problem is not clear (again neither Gail or I understood it at first),
and there is no solution to the problem presented.  What do you do if this
happens?

[9/23/93 public]
Maybe this isn't a bug at all, but I thought it should be pointed out.
As a result of a change being made to the RPC code in 1.0.3, rpccp will
no longer accept remote requests to remove endpoints. The new code changes
the behavior of both the "add mapping" and "remove mapping" subcommands,
but it seems that "add mapping" already correctly refers only to local
endpoints. The "remove mapping" manpage however says that you can operate
on local or remote endpoints, which will no longer be the case.

There is a slight complicating factor in all this, however-- the remote
endpoint functionality can be enabled by building the RPC component with
a preprocessor variable defined (this is now documented in the Porting
Guide; see CRs 8539 and 8451 for more information). Thus, the behavior
of "add mapping" and "remove mapping" will depend on how the implementor
chose to build the component, although the default is that the remote
endpoint functionality is disabled.

[9/24/93 public]
Howard Melman commented as follows:

  This absolutely is a bug, a required doc change as part of
  functionality change.  We should document the default
  behavior we ship, which in this case is the removal of the
  remote case.  You can build DCE with DFS, but by default DFS
  is built and we document DFS :-)

There are two references to the policy command in the Miscellaneous
Commands section of rgy_edit(8sec).  The first contains a lot of useful
information, the second just one sentence.   The second should be removed.

[9/20/93 public]

The sec_rgy_site_open() man page incorrectly states that:

	"sec_rgy_site_open() ... binds to a registry site
	at an arbitrary level of security."

In fact sec_rgy_site_bind binds at a predefined level of security.

Also, the sec_rgy_site_bind() man page states essentially the same thing,
which is more or less correct in this case but could be made more precise
by stating, for example, that: 

	"sec_rgy_site_bind ... binds to a registry site at 
	the security level specified by by the auth_info argument"

The following information needs to be added to the documentation of
the bos create command:
	o A cron process created with the comand runs
	  under the local identity root and the DCE identity
	  self.
	o If the time associated with a cron process is omitted,
	  it defaults to 00:00 on the indicated day.
	o The command will not create an entry in BosConfig
	  if the specified executable file does not exist.

Full Description:

	This is to do with Section 5.5.1 of GDS part of the Porting and
Testing Guide.

	Item 11 in section 5.5.1 says to save the data in directories, but
it does not say what files to save to, then in item 12, it makes some
references to CACHE-DATABSE1, CACHE-DATABASE3, and CACHE-DATABSE4.

	Although it is OK for me to understand what it means, some licensees
find it hard to understand what to do. So we would better say clearly in
Item 11 what file names (CACHE-DATABSE1, CACHE-DATABASE3, and
CACHE-DATABSE4) to save the data for each directory on both machines.

	Then it Item 12, there are some statements which are not exactly
true:

	The first sentence of the second paragraph in Item 12 says "Tests 3
and 4 add some more data to the CACHE-DATABASE1". Some licensees find it
impossible to add data to the file directly. What it means really is 
"Tests 3 and 4 add some more data to the directory restored from 
CACHE-DATABSE1".

	Also Item 12 says "save the status XXXXXXX". What it should say is
"save the new data to XXXXXXX".

[09/22/93 public]
Made the changes specified above.

We need a statement on how to handle the documentation of 
commands supplied as source code only. Specifically, HP 
supplies chpass and su in source code and expects the 
DCE licensees to build and modify them to work on their 
platform.  Currently the DCE doc sec contains man pages and 
references for these commands.  Should the man pages and 
references be deleted?

[9/17/93 public]
I would probably delete the man pages and just information on these
commands in the porting guide.

[11/12/93 public]

Changed "fixby" from 1.0.3 to 1.1 per Hal Lichtin.

[3/16/94]

Hal Lichtin and Rajendra Desai agree that the way they
would like to proceed is to keep the su and chpass man
pages, but eliminate all the information on them and
replace it with a sentence that identifies
these commands as platform-specific and refers
the reader to his/her local operating system documentation.
Assigned this CR to Pam Millett (HP security writer).

Note that the affected files will soon be located
in /admin_ref/man8sec.

[3/28/94 public]

Discussion of using chpass with -l and -n options and
overrides needs to be revised as a result of this CR.

the show.8dts man page describes the counters that are returned by the show
all counters command.

It describes "invalid messages detected" but dtscp didn't show me this
counter.  I'm not sure if this is a code or doc bug.

The documentation did not describe two counters that were displayed (this
is a doc bug)

  Local server not in group = 0
  Servers not in group      = 0

dts admin bugs).

[10/1/93]

no change.

[10/14/93 public]
Deleted "invalid messages detected" as suggested by Tom Jordahl because
it is not part of the code.

Information on the procedures necessary for upgrading from an
operating version of DCE to a newer version of DCE must be included
in the Release Notes on a regular basis from now on. 

From a note from Howard Melman:

 It might be as simple as bringing down DCE, copying in the
 new executables and libdce (and any other libraries) and
 restarting the cell.

 Even if it's that simple, we should document it.

 There should be a note that going from any one version to
 another might require extra steps like upgrading a database,
 see release notes for the version you are dealing with.

[11/2/93 public]

This is done. I inserted a section "Updating a DCE Cell" at the end
of Chapter 2 of the Release Notes, incorporating the substance of a
message from Tom Jordahl. Tom checked the new section.

"If the context is the default context, the information for the default
binding is returned"

The Descritption section of sec_rgy_site_get states:

"If the handle is the default handle (as supplied by the
sec_rgy_site_open() routine), the routine returns the name of the
default site."

No information/definition of the default site/binding can be found by
looking at the man page for sec_rgy_site_open. 

By reading the DCE admin guide - core components section 24.1.1, one can
get an understanding of what is meant by the default security replica
(site). It appears that the default replica is modified via the sec_admin
site command, and that when passed Context=NULL, both
sec_rgy_binding_get_info and sec_rgy_site_get return information about the 
default replica/site.

Proposed Solution:

The descriptions of both sec_rgy_binding_get_info and sec_rgy_site_get
should be made consistent in their terminology (sites and contexts). Also
both descriptions should be modified to state how the caller indicates
the default site/context (with a NULL value passed to Context).

[9/23/93 public]
Fixed and verified.  Verified by Rob Stanzel.
Note that to obtain info on the default handle, you must 
initialize the context parm to sec_rgy_default_handle.     
You cannot do it by passing in null.  Also the sec_admin 
site command sets the default replica (i.e., the replica 
acted on by sec_admin) for the current sec_admin session.  
It has no affect on other prcoesses.  Binding to the 
default handle (sec_rgy_default_handle) 
will return the output parms described in sec_rgy_get_info 
and sec_rgy_binding_get_info, but the handle will not be returned.

[9/15/93 public]

The man page for sec_rgy_site_is_readonly indicates that the error
sec_rgy_server_unavailable is somehow an important or significant 
aspect of the behavior of this function. Since sec_rgy_site_is_readonly
has no output parameters, and only returns a boolean, indicating whether
or not the site is an update or slave site, mention of
sec_rgy_server_is_unavailable under ERRORS is not appropriate.

On examination of the implementation, it appears that the lower level function,
rca_site_check_readonly, does percieve status values but that these values
are not made available via the public function sec_rgy_site_is_readonly.

Given a return value which can represent only whether or not the site
is an update site, coupled with evidence, that there are errors which
can be detected by the lower level function, it is clear that the caller
of sec_rgy_site_is_readonly will not be able to distinguish whether or not
the returned master/query status of the replica was determined in the
presence or absence of errors. The presumption being that the caller should
not rely on information determined in the presence of errors.

Proposed Enhancement:

Add output status parameter to function to make it possible to disambiguate
master/query status from presence of errors. If this is not done, the
ERRORS section should probably be removed and possible replaced with a note
about whether or not one or both of the returned values (true/false) can be
returned when the routine failed to determine the type of the site.

Section 8.8 of the Administration Guide, entitled "Backing Up
Namespace Information", omits to mention the actual files that
should be saved in order to back up the CDS namespace. This
information should be added to this section.

[9/16/93 public]

Note that information about the specific files that should be
saved in order to back up CDS clearinghouses and the Security
registry can be found in Section 11.5 (i.e., section 5 of Chapter 11)
of the Porting Guide. This begins on page 11-76 of the 1.0.2 edition.

[9/17/93 public]

Oops, sorry. What I should have said is that information about what
to back up can be found in the source (shell scripts and checklists)
which Section 11.5 of the Porting Guide documents. So, in order to
learn which files actually have to be saved, you should go to

    <dce-root-dir>/src/test/systest/admin/cds

or

    <dce-root-dir>/src/test/systest/admin/sec

and examine the relevant file(s) there.

The functionality provided by sec_rgy_site_binding_get_info() appears to
make the function sec_rgy_site_get() unnecessary. The documentation for 
sec_rgy_site_binding_get_info() speaks of server name, while the
documentation for sec_rgy_site_get() speaks of site name. It apperars that
despite the difference in names given to the returned values, the
implementations are the same.

Proposed solution:

Simplyfy the API by defuncting sec_rgy_site_get or at least marking it as
on it's way out (and therefore not recommended).

Full Description:

        The sec_rgy_site_binding_get_info man page in DCE 1.0.2 says that
this routine will return "the name of the node on which server is
resident" in the server_name argument. Actually, depending on how the 
site was opened (sec_rgy_site_open), sec_rgy_site_binding_get_info will
return either the CDS (e.g. /.../tofino_cell/subsys/dce/sec/master) name
of the security server or the protocol tower  (e.g.
ncadg_ip_udp:130.105.1.60) identitying the bound security server.

Repeat By:

        Call sec_rgy_site_open with "" site name and pass the rgy_handle
        to sec_rgy_site_binding_get_info and see what it returns via the
        server_name argument. Also look at the sec_rgy_site_binding_get_info
         man page in DCE 1.0.2 doc.

Proposed Solution:

        modify the documentation.

The rpc_ns_profile_elt_remove(3rpc) man page must describe the affect of
passing in a null value for the interface id (the default profile element
is removed) and what the affect is on other parameters (is member_name
ignored in this case?).

[9/24/93]

Assigned to Steve Lewontin.

[10/12/93]

Specifying NULL for the if_id removes the default profile element.
From the code, internally this results in a call to
rpc_ns_profile_elt_inq_begin() with inquiry_type set to
rpc_c_profile_default_elt.  Such a search ignores the member_name
argument.  Added text to reflect this.

[9/13/93 public]
In the rpc_ns_profile_elt_remove(3rpc) man page, in the synopsis there is a
*L in the if_id parameter that should be removed.  Also in the Description
section the second paragraph has parens around entry_name that should not
be there.  Also the sentence could be improved to make it clear that any
entry that the member_name refers to is not deleted, only the reference to
it in the profile is removed.

[9/24/93 public]

Assigned this bug to myself, and fixed the formatting errors.
I rewrote the 2nd paragraph in the Description section, but
need to verify its technical accuracy with Howard before I call
the bug fixed.

This is really a more general problem and all the man pages should be
checked for this, but here is one that bit me:

In rpc_ns_binding_export(3rpc), under the list of status code and their
values, it says that the meanings are given as well.  For
rpc_s_nothing_to_export, the "meaning" is "Nothing to export".  This does
not help me at all.  I would prefer it to say something like "no bindings
were entered to be exported" or "there was no entry name given", or
whatever the proper error is.

On this same page for rpc_s_no_ns_permission, the meaning is "No permission
for name service operation."  Well, the operation I assume is
rpc_ns_binding_export, at least as a user thats what I would expect.  I
want to know what permissions are required.  And if the operation is really
rpc_ns_binding_export then be more precise.  Say "Write permission to the
<entry_name> is required for the rpc_ns_binding_export operation.", or if
you must "for this operation".

If you want more, look at the same page for rpc_s_wrong_kind_of_binding.
The meaning doesn't add anything, and the first thing you should be asking
is "what is the right binding?  what other kinds of bindings are there?"

If you want even more, turn the pages and look at other man pages in this
section, they all follow the same pattern.

[9/24/93 public]

The existing man page rpc_status_codes(7rpc) in
the App Dev Ref provides more extensive explanations
of RPC status codes than are shown on the individual man pages.
Some explanations are better than others, but in general,
the explanations are significantly better than those
in the man pages.

However, the documentation strategy for the RPC status codes
(and the rest of the DCE APIs) will need to be revisited at DCE 1.1
in light of the DCE 1.1 serviceability project and the
planned DCE Error Messages manual. Since the strategy for
documenting status codes in man pages and the descriptions
given for each status code must be addressed at 1.1,
I am changing the "fix by" field from "1.0.3" to "1.1"
and assigning this bug to Bob Mathews (DCE 1.1 doc project
lead).

Howard is correct that there is inadequate corrective action provided for
error messages and status codes.  The answer should be found in the new
Problem Determination Guide.  This new document will be a compilation of
all error messages and status codes and will contain detailed explanations
and recovery actions.  This should alliviate the problem Howard sites.

The documentation does not say enough about the broadcast capabilities
of the RPC runtime.

In particular, it needs to say more about why broadcast is not such
a good idea.  

For example,

1. Not all systems and networks support broadcasting.

    - In particular, it is not supported by the RPC
      connection-oriented protocol

2. Broadcasts are limited to hosts on the local network.

3. Broadcasts make inefficient use of network bandwidth and
   processor cycles.

    - A client may receive responses from many servers,
      dropping all but the first.

    - Every host on the network must read in the packet.

    - When broadcasting on a partially-bound handle, all
      rpcd's on the local network must be scheduled to
      process the request packet.

4. The RPC runtime library does not support "at most once"
   semantics for broadcast operations; it applies idempotent
   semantics to all such operations.

I think there is also a restriction on the size of the input argument.
Something like a single rpc pdu, but you'ld better check with the dg

Right, the input arguments for broadcast calls are limited to 944 bytes.

Also deleted a conflicting paragraph from fundamentals.gpsml 
that read as follows:

With the RPC communications protocols, a \*Lmaybe\*O or
\*Lbroadcast\*O call lacks guarantees; an \*Lidempotent\*O call
guarantees that the data for a remote procedure
call is received and processed in order zero
or more times; and an \*Lat-most-once\*O call guarantees that the call data
is received and processed in order zero or one time.

The options in unexport(8rpc) mentions the -u switch and the command
doesn't take it.  The synopsis is correct.

[9/24/93 public]

CRs 7750, 7561, and this CR seem to illustrate the process
of discovery. CR7750 reported that the -u option was missing
from rpccp_unexport's synopsis but existed in the Options section.
Julie Buckler fixed and closed that bug. CR7561 reported that
the description of the -u option needed improvement. Julie
Buckler fixed and closed that bug for all the rpccp admin
commands that documented -u, including rpccp_unexport.
This CR reports that the -u option is actually not a
supported option for rpccp_unexport and that the synopsis
(which, in the 1.0.2 docs doesn't show it) is correct. 
I have removed -u from the synopsis and the text in the
source and have changed this bug to fixed. I will verify with 
Howard Melman that the code does not implement -u before
I close this bug.

Section 10.7 of the App Dev Guide describes rpccp in 1 paragraph and three
example input lines.  It should describe all the commands, or refer to
someplace that does (the man page, or a section in the admin_gd, see
another bug I opened on that).

It's probably sufficient to refer to a man page for developers.  They will
need to know how to view/modify NSI objects while testing their
applications.  This is how this documentation should be biased.

Looking at the Admin Guide-Core book I see that there is frightfully little
on rpccp there.  The entire RPC chapter is 8 pages, the first 5 of which is
rpcd. 

Section 1.3 discusses in brief the rpccp commands.  This section needs to
be improved.  First a discussion of the different types of NSI Namespace
objects (entries, groups, profiles), needs to be added or at least a
reference to the app_gd (chap 15 is quite good) should be included.  My
preference is a rewrite with a bent toward what a sys admin would need to
know.  

Then each command should be described and an example shown.  It should be
biased to what a sys admin would need to do, e.g., how to set up profiles
at your site and how to tell users to setup/modify their own personal
profiles.  Examples (WITH OUTPUT!) should be included.

[9/15/93 public]

The 1.0.2 version of DCE Administration Guide/Core Components,
Section 1.3 "RPC Control Program" does contain a (generic)
pointer to the chapter on NSI usage, as this CR suggests.

I consulted with Bob Mathews to determine how to resolve this
CR. Bob agrees that improving the rpccp administration documentation
is desirable, but he feels (and I concur) that the CR should be 
considered an enhancement. Because the OSF doc group has limited
time and resources, they cannot address this enhancement for 1.0.3.
As a result, I am changing the CR from "def" to "enh" and "fixby"
from "1.0.3" to "1.1". The doc group will revisit the rpccp
administration documentation and this enhancement request
as part of its DCE 1.1 revision to include the dcecp administration
information.

[11/5/93 public]

Steve Lewontin rightly pointed out that he should not be
assigned to this bug. I am reassigning this bug to Bob
Mathews until a new owner for the control program
administration documentation is found (Larry Kaplan
is the present owner, but only for a few more hours...)

There will be a change to rpcd in 1.0.3 such that it will reject
requests from remote hosts to add/delete endpoints from the
endpoint map.  This is to minimize the security hole present
in previous version of DCE where any unauthenticated user
could (via a program or rpccp) add or delete endpoints.

See ot 8451 for other interesting details.

An ifdef (REMOTE_ENDPOINT_ACCESS) needs to be documented
in the release notes (or porting guide).  By default, it is not
defined, which gives the new behavior.  If turned on, the behavior
is the same as 1.0.2 and earlier.

This change affects the rpccp 'add mapping' and 'remove mapping' commands.

The ifdef is relevant for rpcd and rpccp.  If defined for rpcd,
it will reject remote requests to modify (but not read) the endpoint
map.  If defined for rpccp, the help message remove mapping will not 
show the [host-address] argument.

This documentation will probably not be needed for 1.1, as dced will replace
rpcd, and will add security/acl stuff on to the endpoint map.
This is 1.0.3 item only.

The documentation related to read-only fileset availability needs to
be updated to reflect the following.  First, if the read-write version
of a fileset (configured for scheduled replication) becomes unavailable,
the read-only versions become unavailable upon expiration of the FailAge;
if the read-only version at the same site as the readpwrite version of
a fileset (configured for release replication) becomes unavailable,
the read-only versions become unavailable upon expiration of the FailAge.
Second, if a Cache Manager is using data from a read-only fileset and a
new version of that read-only fileset becomes available, the Cache
Manager does not attempt to access that new data until the the MaxAge
expires

I think we should remove the rdacl manpages.  Programmers are supposed to use the
sec_acl_XXX functions.

[8/23/93 public]
Not until we're convinced that the generic ACL manager is so complete that
there's no way anybody could need to write their own (the rdacl manpages are
there for server writers now, not client writers).

reference to the sec_acl_mgr routines; *those* should be flushed.  (I think
I opened an OT on doing that.)

[5/18/94 public]
Removed references to sec_acl_mgr call in following man pages:
app_ref/man3sec/rdacl_get_printstring.3sec
app_ref/man3sec/rdacl_get_referral.3sec
app_ref/man3sec/rdacl_lookup.3sec
app_ref/man3sec/rdacl_replace.3sec
app_ref/man3sec/rdacl_get_access.3sec                
app_ref/man3sec/rdacl_test_access.3sec
app_ref/man3sec/rdacl_get_manager_types.3sec         
app_ref/man3sec/rdacl_test_access_on_behalf.3sec
app_ref/man3sec/rdacl_get_mgr_types_semantics.3sec 

Verified by me.

[8/19/93 public]
The OSF DCE 1.0.2 Application Development Reference incorrectly 
indicates a function return value of 0 (zero) corresponds to a 
successful return for the several pthread_set* functions. These
functions, according to POSIX P1003.4a/D4, return either the 
old priority or old policy. A successful return is anything 
other than -1. For detailed information on each function, refer 
to the POSIX draft.

[8/19/93 public]
Changed Interest List CC from `jaffe@transarc.com' to `' 
Added field Transarc Deltas with value `' 
Added field Transarc Herder with value `' 
Added field Transarc Status with value `'

[08/19/93 public]
Assigned to writer Doug Weir.

[09/21/93 public]
Made the change specified above in all the pthread_set reference pages.
Note that I am still waiting on a query as to whether the same correction
should be made to the pthread_attr_set reference pages.

[09/21/93 public]
All the necessary changes have been made. Roger explained...

  Regarding the pthread_attr_set* question, ...

  The POSIX draft does not specify the return value. The DCE implementation,
  however, returns 0 (zero) for success, and -1 for failure for all of the
  pthread_attr_set* functions.

So the pthread_attr_set* reference pages don't need to be changed; they
already say the correct thing.

as a valid command. This is incorrect. It is not a valid command 
and the documentation should be changed.

[08/17/93 public]
Assigned this CR to writer Bob Mathews.

[11/12/93 public]

Changed 'fixby' from 1.0.3 to 1.1 per H. Lichtin.

[11/12/93 public]

The name of the characteristic (and subcommand) has changed to "local time
differential factor".  In the show.8dts man page, I changed the name, kept
the existing description, and moved the text so that the list of
characteristics remains sorted.  I also changed the name in the table
titled "Unsettable DTS Characteristics" in the Administration Guide chapter
"Managing the DCE Distributed Time Service".

While doing this, I noticed that "local servers" was in the list of
characteristics in both files.  I verified that "local servers" is not a
characteristic--for instance, it's not included in the output of "show all
characteristics".  I removed this entry from the list of characteristics.
The "show local servers" command is already documented in detail elsewhere
in both files.

Changed status to verified.  Verified by Tom Jordahl and me.

The dce_error_inq_text.3rpc reference page in the RPC section of
the Application Development Reference should be moved into the
DCE section of the same manual.  The source for this reference page
should thus be moved from the man3rpc subdirectory to the man3dce
subdirectory so it can be with the rest of the dce_* routines.
The Description file should also be updated to reflect this change.

Fixed and verified by me.  I defuncted the file
dce_error_inq_text.3rpc, since the new version, dce_error_inq_text.3dce
has already been written and is in place.  I checked the
Description file to make sure this change would not cause
any build problems.

[10/20/94 public]
Closed bug.

[8/12/93 public]
Need to create the following new i18n-related reference pages 
in the Application Development Reference:

	man3dce/dce_msg_get_msg.3dce (catch-all for msg.3dce routines)
	man3dce/dce_printf.3dce (catch-all for printf.3dce routines)

I have just added source (from Rich Salz) for these two reference pages
to the doc tree, but more work needs to be done:

	1) These two reference pages need to be split up and rewritten
	   such that each routine is documented on a separate ref page.

	2) Sections describing Input Parameters and Output Parameters
	   match the rest of our DCE reference doc.  Sections for
	   Return Values, Files, and Related Information should
	   also be added where appropriate.

	3) The existing intro.3dce reference page needs to be rewritten
	   to reflect the many i18n and serviceability routines
	   added to this section.  

	4) These new reference pages may need to be expanded,
	   clarified or modified as DCE 1.1 work proceeds.

Regarding: dce_msg_get_msg.3dce

The individual dce_msg routines are described in 
the following separate man pages:

	dce_msg_cat_close.3dce
	dce_msg_cat_get_msg.3dce
	dce_msg_cat_open.3dce
	dce_msg_define_msg_table.3dce
	dce_msg_get.3dce
	dce_msg_get_cat_msg.3dce
	dce_msg_get_default_msg.3dce
	dce_msg_get_msg.3dce
	dce_msg_translate_table.3dce

A separate dce_msg_intro man page will also be produced.

Regarding: dce_printf.3dce

Both John Bowe and Rich Salz want to document all of the printf 
routines in this one man page.   This man page covers the 
following routines:

	dce_printf
	dce_fprintf
	dce_sprintf
	dce_pgm_printf
	dce_pgm_fprintf
	dce_pgm_sprintf

A separate man page (dce_pgm_printf.3dce) duplicates this 
man page by means of a .so inclusion.

[10/20/94 public]
Closed bug.

The final list of reference pages created in response to this CR 
is as follows:


	dce_error_inq_text.3dce
	dce_msg_cat_close.3dce
	dce_msg_cat_get_msg.3dce
	dce_msg_cat_open.3dce
	dce_msg_define_msg_table.3dce
	dce_msg_get.3dce
	dce_msg_get_cat_msg.3dce
	dce_msg_get_default_msg.3dce
	dce_msg_get_msg.3dce
	dce_msg_translate_table.3dce
	dce_pgm_printf.3dce
	dce_printf.3dce

CR 12619 covers the way dce_pgm_printf.3dce and dce_printf.3dce
were documented (this is done now by two separate ref pages,
and there is no longer an .so call in dce_pgm_printf.3dce).

CR 12204 covers the creation of a dce_msg_intro.3dce ref page
that describes this API.

It would be nice if the list of macros in the security section of the
Porting Guide were alphabetized.  It would make it easy to look up macros.
This applies to the RPC and GDS sections as well, and probably all of them.

The security section doesn't mention the environment variable DEBUG_SEC (at
least that I could find).  It should say what the various settings are and
what they do.  I'm amazed that the testing section doesn't give this as
information on how to get debugging output.  It does mention the -verbose
and -debug switches on secd and sec_clientd but it doesn't describe their
output!

The pthread_attr_setprio man page says (in "Parameters" section):

"...To specify a priority midway between the minimum and maximum...
specify the following:

pri_rr_mid = (PRI_RR_MIN + PRI_RR_MAX)\2"

If this formula is used to get the default priority value from
PRI_OTHER_MIN and PRI_OTHER_MAX, then it falls 1 short of the value used in
the code. The correct formula is

pri_rr_mid = (PRI_RR_MIN + PRI_RR_MAX + 1)\2

formula in the pthread_setprio.3thr reference page.

OSF does not provide a generic ACL manager, just hokey sample code.  We
document the routines as sec_acl_mgr_XXX in the AppRefGuide as if those
routines existed.  This is very confusing.  We also discuss the routines
in the App Dev Guide as if they existed, but then we tell people (a bit
later on) that they don't exist, but we do give you source so you should
change them as you see fit.  That last part makes the AppRefGuide manpages
even more useless.  Undocument these routines, except perhaps a small
reference in somewhere to the source code.  (Note that in DCE 1.1 we will
be providing a true generic ACL manager.)

In addition to the work Pam Millette did in 7705, defuncting the sec_acl_mgr*
man pages, I have removed references to them from these files -
  ./dce_books/app_ref/man3sec/rdacl_replace.3sec

Deferring this CR until 1.2.
There still seems to be a mention of the sec_acl_mgr routines in the file

app_gd/security/1_overv.gpsml

I think this reference should be removed.

Re-opening for fixing in Prentice-Hall phase of work.

[5/17/96 public]

This bug is closed; the final reference mentioned above seems to have
been long since removed.

enumerate_interfaces in rpc/runtime/ipnaf_bsd.c (and also ipnaf_sys.c in
the machine dependent subdirectories of runtime and kruntime) allocates a
1024-byte buffer on the stack for the ifreq structures returned by an
ioctl(..., SIOCGIFCONF, ...). Each ifreq structure is at least 32 bytes
long, so there is space for at most 32 ifreqs.  Hitachi claims that that is
not enough for their purposes and proposes that the stack allocation be
replaced by a malloc with a #defined size.

Two objections to that are that the malloc idea does not work for kruntime
and that the #defined size does little to enhance the flexibility of the
software. But since the file is (supposed to be - see CR#8365) only a
template, perhaps the best thing to do is add a comment to the porting
guide, explaining the alternatives.

Fixed and verified.  Verified by Mike Burati.

[7/21/93 public]

Some corrections:

The renewable ticket *flag* itself is implemented (as is the database
support for it), however, DCE cannot take advantage of it at the present
time and there may be bugs in the underlying support since it's untested.

[7/20/93 public]
In example code that uses sec_acl_mgr_is_authorized(), the manager_type parameter
position always contains the value "sec_acl_type_object".  Unfortunately, this is
one of the defined values of an enum of type sec_acl_type_t (defined in
/usr/include/dce/aclbase.idl).  Programmers trying to sort out how to implement
ACL managers may be mislead by this coincidence (error?)--I just had to explain
it to someone, as a matter of fact.

Example code that appears in this form can be found on several of the Security
API man pages (for example, sec_acl_mgr_is_authorized() and sec_acl_mgr_configure())
and in at least one place in the App Dev Guide (sorry, I can't remember where).

  Bob noticed that the man page for sec_rgy_site_close includes
"sec_rgy_server_unavailable" as a possible return code. A quick look
at that routine seems to say that that code cannot be returned. Which is
correct?
  PS: A new line of code to clear the status after the DISPOSE() call
might mask any uninteresting errors from rpc_binding_free()...

        The man page for pthread_attr_setstacksize() does not include
        the error code returned when pthread_attr_setstacksize() is called
        with an invalid stacksize argument.


Proposed Solution:

        Add the following to the "RETURN VALUES" section of the
        pthread_attr_setstacksize() man page:

        Return  Error           Description

Full Description:

        The man page for pthread_attr_setsched() claims that this function
        sets errno to EPERM when

                "The caller does not have the appropriate
                 priviledges to set the priority of the
                 specified thread"

        This statement is false because pthread_attr_setsched() does not
        modify a "specified thread"; it modifies an attribute object. In
        addition, this function sets scheduling attribute -- not priority.


        Also:  pthread_attr_setsched() sets errno to EINVAL when given an
               invalid scheduling value.  This is omitted.

Proposed Solution:

        Specify the correct situation that will cause pthread_attr_setsched()
        to set errno is EPERM.

        List error code returned after passing an invalid scheduling value.

The short term fix is to set the environment variable IDL_GEN_AUX_FILES
for backwards compatibility with the old IDL.  The long term fix is
to modify the makefiles to remove dependencies on the aux files.  Lowered
priority, added jaffe to interest list.

[10/01/93 public]

I don't know why this is assigned to me, as I have no idea
what this problem is about.  I'm reassigning it to Ron, who
apparantly knows enought about it to determine whether this
is still a problem or not.

[10/01/93 public]
This is a build issue.  This environment variable needs to be
set in the rc_files or somewhere or the build will fail.
Don't know if this is an issue for the rc_files on the
final tapes.  Re-assigning to marcyw for final judgement.

[11/12/93 public]
I'm not sure what the original problem was but in any case it is fixed now.
IDL_GEN_AUX_FILES is set in the dce/Buildconf file.  If someone wishes to
remove dependencies on aux files then defects should be opened against the
appropriate component.

Defect marked as closed.

[7/9/93 public]
There is a limitation in the ACL remote interface, in that you cannot place a
lock on the ACL, with the intent of replacing it after reading and modifying
(because the interface is not transaction based...).  Because of this
limitation, it is possible for two users to simultaneously use acl_edit on the
same ACL, make separate modifications, and the one replaced last will overwrite
any changes made by the other.  This limitation and the potential effects of
the problem need to be documented in the User's Guide where it describes the
manipulation of DCE ACLs.  A warning that the number of principals with rights
to modify any particular ACL should be limited (to 1 if possible), to help
prevent the problem from occurring should also be added.

The porting and testing guide page 3-33 describes the -p flag 
of the runtime/perf/server as having two arguments. By looking at the 
implementation of the server it is appearent that there is an optional
third argument, the name of a keytab file which should alos be documented.

	[-p <authn proto>,<principal>[,<keytab file>]

Also, we should probably point out (maybe in section 3.4.2) that a
keytab file must be setup (probably with rgy_edit ktadd) for a server
principal before it will be possible to run the server program with
proto = private key authentication. If this setup is not done, the server
will print out the following message at startup.

***Error setting principal - Requested key is unavailble (dce/sec)

In response to CR #7973, I have removed the "Too Many server Detected"
counter from dtscp.  This should be removed from the show(8dts) man
page.  This counter was never incremented by the code.

It has been replaced by a "Time Provider Timeouts Detected" counter.
This counter is incremented when a dtsd server process initiates
contact with a Time Provider, and does not receive the initial
response within the 'Local Set Timeout' value (default 5 seconds).

This problem occurred on the PMAX because the provider didn't get
back to dtsd in the allotted time, probably due to system load.

The recommended action if you get too many of these timeouts is to increase
the 'local set timeout' (aka 'lan timeout') to a higher value.

In addtion, the set(8dts) man page should probably be updated to indicate
that the local set timeout value is used to control the *initial* contact
with a time provider.  In this initial contact, the time provider itself
provides a timeout value for actually reporting back times.  This allows
a provider attached to a slow source (a modem) to tell dtsd to wait for
5 minutes or something.

The Admin Reference Description file currently does not include the
diskless reference pages, so these pages do not get built into the book.
This was done because we do not publish these pages in the Prentice Hall
version of the book.  However, we should include the pages on the version
that goes on the tape.  Therefore I would recommend that we specify them in
the Description file, but put a comment before the entry/ies indicating that
they should be commented out for Prentice Hall production.  It would also
be possible to use a PH ifdef, but that might be going too far.  We should
also check to ensure that these pages get built into the online man pages.

[7/13/93 public]
Changed to "verified".  These files are built into the online man 
pages independently of whether or not they are specified in the
Description file for the Admin Ref.  So, that part's OK.

I added the Diskless Support Service reference pages to the 
Description file as the penultimate chapter in the Admin Ref, 
and also added comment lines stating that these ref pages are not 
to be included in Prentice-Hall versions.  I also adjusted the
chapter division pages (chapter.6 and chapter.7 in the chapters
subdirectory) to match the new chapter sequence.

The AES has some discussion of pointers and arrays and their use in IDL.
In particular,
	void op ([in, out] long s, [in, out, size_is(s)] long **myarray);
is an array of pointers to longs, not a pointer to an array of longs.
This is a C "ambiguity" that has no effect in standard C, but does
need clarification when IDL is used.  This should be added to the AppDevGd.

It appears that in some cases our docs refer to cell-profile as
cell_profile.  I've appended the comment from original mail message
reporting this and the result of a find/grep for all such instances
(although I may have forgotten to make the grep case-insensitive).

The comment:
"I notice that some of the documentation (esp., the Prentice-Hall
rpccp manpage) uses the spelling "cell_profile" with an underscore, but
it's supposed to be "cell-profile" with a hyphen."

The man page for pthread_attr_create describes it as returning
EINVAL if the value specified by attr is invalid. But there is
no way to check the validity of the parameter (it's a pointer
through which the routine returns an attributes structure) and
indeed the code never returns EINVAL.

[7/7/93 public]

Another reported problem with pthread_attr_create DESCRIPTION part:

        pthread_attr_create man page says (in DESCRIPTION section):

        "... When an attribute object is used to create a thread, the values
        of the individual attributes determine the characteristics of the
        new object.... Changing individual attributes does not affect  any
        ^^^^^^^^^^
	objects that were previously created using the attributes object."
	^^^^^^^

        It should be "the new thread" instead of "the new object" at the end
        of the statement above. And "any threads" instead of "any objects".

[7/7/93 public]

One more reported problem with this man page:

        Man page for pthread_attr_create(3thr) states
        "...The attributes object
          created by this routine is only used in calls to
          pthread_create()."

        I have seen from pthread.h that this gets used
        in other places - in calls like
        pthread_attr_getinheritsched ( and more ).
        So "only" in the quoted sentence is not entirely
        accurate.

The app. ref. for sec_login_get_expiration() shows by example a use of
the function sec_login_refresh_identity which implies that 
sec_login_refresh_identity returns FALSE when status is set to
to sec_login_s_refresh_ident_change.

THis is inconsistent with the man page for sec_login_refresh_identity whose
description and example indicate that FALSE will be returned when the
login context cannot be renewed.

Proposed Solution:

Make bothe xamples consistent

[6/22/93 public]
Assigned this CR to writer Pam Millette.

[09/03/93 public]
This is not inconsistent.  The man page says that it returns  false when the
context cannot be renewed.  Getting this bad status (or any error status)
means that the context cannot be renewed, so it seems consistent to me...
There is a problem there in that the error code is
 sec_login_s_refresh_ident_bad
not ident_change as the example uses.

[9/3/93 public]
sec_login_s_refresh_ident_change changed to sec_login_s_refresh_indent_bad 
in example in sec_login_get_expiration.3sec.  Also 
changed "exit(error_context_expired)" to exit(error_context_not_renewable) 
in example.  

Status changed to verified.  Verififed by Mike Burati.

rpccp show mapping should allow -v option -- see rpc.runtime.src
CMVC 2538 for reference

Problem with remove mapping using rpccp when -v upto option is given.

I used show mapping to list mappings on system, then I tried removing
the mapping with -v option.

  <object>         019EE420-682D-11C9-A607-08002B0DEA7A
  <interface id>   019EE420-682D-11C9-A607-08002B0DEA7A,1.0
  <string binding> ncadg_ip_udp:192.100.227.27[2547]
  <annotation>     Time Service

Was one of the item on list. I then remove using:

rpccp remove mapping -b ncadg_ip_udp:192.100.227.27[2547] \
-i 019EE420-682D-11C9-A607-08002B0DEA7A,2.0 -v upto


Tom Li

    <Note by kwalker (Ken Walker), 92/10/20 17:53:07, action: note>
For the record, none of the parameters for the -v option seem to work.  The
-v flag doesn't do a thing for me...

    <Note by phighley (Paul T. Highley), 92/11/25 10:41:55, action: note>
After looking at this defect, the rpccp/rpcd code and documentation I have
come to the following conclusions:

  1. The rpccp remove mapping documentation should remove it's reference to
     the '-v' option.

     Currently the documentation has the  '-v' option mentioned for remove
     mapping but in a contradictory way.  It states that if the '-v' option
     is used without the '-i' option it will be ignored ... but the remove
     mapping command REQUIRES the '-i' option.

     It would be possible to implement this functionality (currently there is
     nothing in rpccp to support the '-v' option for remote mapping) but I
     don't think it is what the designers had in mind.  They already restrict
     you from removing more than one interface at a time and if you want to
     remove more that one binding for a particular interface you must
     explicitly list them out.

  2. The rpccp show mapping code needs to allow the '-v' option.

     Currently the rpccp show mapping documentation says the '-v' option is
     valid but the code does not allow it.  There is code in show_mapping() to
     handle it but the command line syntax checking doesn't let the '-v'
     option through with the show mapping command.

  3. The rpcd handles the '-v upto' option incorrectly.

     The rpcd is handling '-v upto' in the opposite manner than the
     documentation states. If versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0 for a 
     pariticular
	r
     interface are in the endpoint database and you do a show mapping for
     version 2.1 with the '-v upto' option you will receive mappings fo1.0.
     versions 2.1 and 3.0 instead of the correct versions 2.1, 2.0 and 1.0

I am going to use this defect to fix problem #2.  I have opened CMVC 
defect 3720 for problem #1 and defect 3721 for problem #3.

    <Note by page (Scott Page), 93/01/20 13:04:48, action: assign>
Defect is actually being worked by HP/DEC/OSF.  Some may be completed

rpccp -v upto option described incorrectly.

THIS DEFECT IS TO BE RETURNED TO OSF VIA OT BY IDD.

In (at least) these rpccp commands, there is a table describing the -v
flag.

  import
  show mapping
  show profile


The upto option is described incorrectly:

  upto The major and minor versions must be less than or equal to
       those specified.


This should be:

  upto The major version must be less than or equal to that specified.

       If the major versions are equal, the minor version must be less
       than or equal to that specifed.

I'm changing the fix-by baseline to 1.0.3 (vice 1.0.2a). The reason
for this is that the GDS material referred to involves code that was
put in the "unintegrated" tree for 1.0.2. Since this essentially
doesn't change for 1.0.2a, and since references to transient uninteg-
rated stuff shouldn't be in the books, the GDS text referred to above
shouldn't be moved until the code it describes is integrated into
the DCE tree. The earliest that this will happen is 1.0.3, as I under-
stand.

[11/16/93 public]

This has been done. It involved updating the System Test chapter of
the Porting Guide with new information about the GDS shadow test.

[11/17/93 public]

The material referred to above is about the rpc.cds.3 system test. All
the items that don't involve unintegrated code have been moved into
Chapter 11 of the Porting Guide. The unintegrated code descriptions
should stay in the Release Notes for 1.0.2a, since the code itself
will still be unintegrated.

The material referred to above described the rpc.sec.2 system test.
All items that do not involve unintegrated code have now been moved
into Chapter 11 of the Porting Guide. The items that describe unin-
tegrated code have been left where they are in the Release Notes,
since all code that was unintegrated in 1.0.2 will remain so in 1.0.2a,
and references to the "unintegrated" tree should not occur in the
books.

Actually, RDACL is the RPC interface, and not what users should
use.  I think the RDACL manpages should be removed.

[8/20/93 public]
I've added the error codes to rdcal_get_access and marked this

rsalz, the question of whether or not the rdacl manpages should be

The following sec_login* api man pages require explanation on the error
code sec_login_s_not_certified. This error status is a warning and not a
real error; i.e. the login context has been validated only using sec_login_
validate_identity api. Applications which use these api's must not only
look for error_status_ok as a succesful completion but also look for the 
sec_login_s_not_certified error status as well.

The following error code must be added to the sec_login_refresh_identity
man page:
	- sec_login_s_refresh_ident_change

[7/13/93 public]

I had hoped to make this a dup of 6199, and reopen 6199 with the comments
included here, but 6199 has been made inactive, so I will just
modify this report; note that I have added 6308, and 61999 as related
defects.

sec_login_refresh_identity does not return
sec_login_s_refresh_ident_change, and one result of the rewrite
done for OT 6199, was that the example no longer features a test for
sec_login_s_refresh_ident_change. Some indication of an administrative
change is probably returned, but the key point is that the validation
should be done in either case, so checking for the "warning" status is
not a decision point in the use of this function.

What remains to be fixed in the man page:

1. The rewitten man page incorrectly refers to the output status
   value as the returned value of the function.

2. The man page does not describe the properties (when true is returned,
   and when false is returned) of the boolean returned value of the
   function

[7/15/93 public]
 I am not sure I completely understand what you are asking for in this CR.  
I will add a "Return Values" head that describes the meanings of the 
boolean32 value.  That should take care of 2. (above).  But, I'm not 
sure what you mean in 1.  Also are you requesting that the example be 
changed and the sec_login_s_refresh_ident_change error message 
be added to the list of errors?  (This error message isn't in the idl 
file.)  Could you restate your change requests?

[monzillo 7/19/93 public]  
In 1, I was stating that the following sentence,

"On successful completion, the routine returns error_status_ok."

which is used to describe the semantics of the output parameter, status,
implies that the "returned value" of the function is a status code.
I believe the sentence should be changed to something like
	
"On successful completion, status is assigned the value error_status_ok."

No, I am not suggesting that sec_login_s_refresh_ident_change error message
be added to the list of errors. That part of my note was only intended to
clarify that the original problem for which this defect had been opened
had already been resolved. I apologize for the confusion which probably
was caused by my not inserting a header between the original text and the
stuff I added

[10/21/93 public]
Keith and I have gone through the 1.0.2 DFS documentation release notes.  Some
of the notes have been obviated by code changes; some are being moved to the
code portion of the DFS release notes; most have been addressed under other
defect numbers.  Of the 1.0.2 release notes, the following pair remain valid:
 
.ML
.LI
Many commands in the \*Lbos\*O and \*Lfts\*O command suites include a
\*L-localauth\*O option. The option allows you to direct the \*Lbos\*O or
\*Lfts\*O program to use the DFS server principal of the machine on which the
command is issued as the identity of the issuer of the command. Because the
command executes with the identity of the machine, the DFS server principal of
the machine from which the command issued must be included in the necessary
administrative lists; otherwise, the command fails. For example, including the
\*L-localauth\*O option with a \*Lbos\*O command issued from machine \*Lfs1\*O
to machine \*Lfs2\*O succeeds only if the DFS server principal of machine
\*Lfs1\*O is included in the \*Ladmin.bos\*O list on machine \*Lfs2\*O.
.P
To simplify this requirement, create a group that contains all DFS server
principals and include that group in the \*Ladmin.fl\*O, \*Ladmin.bos\*O, and
\*Ladmin.ft\*O lists on all trusted DFS server machines in your cell. If your
cell includes administrative domains, the latter two lists may require special
domain-specific groups.
.LI
As necessary, the documentation correctly indicates when you need to include
double quotes around an argument to a command for the command to execute
properly. In such cases, however, the documentation mistakenly uses directional
quotes, `` '', as examples of double quotes. Legal values are " " or \*C' '\*O.
A command that requires double quotes will not execute properly if you include
the directional quotes currently employed in the documentation.
.LE
 
We are currently preparing the 1.0.3 documentation release notes for forwarding
to OSF; we will include these two remaining release notes in the 1.0.3 notes.

The rantest_api test for DTS has been/will be enhanced slightly.
It now takes a 'count' argument to specify how many iterations
to do.  This change it 100% backwards compatible as before
this test took no arguments and ran forever.  This behavior
is preserved, so these doc changes are not critical for 1.0.3.

The new usage is:
	rantest_api [count]

This is just something I added to make my life easier, so it might
be nice to tell people about it.

NOTE: if this test is placed under the TET environment, changes
more dramatic that this may have been made to this test.

On the man page for 'fts crserverentry', the following description
is wrong:
-principal name
        Specifies the abbreviation for the DFS server principal
        to be registered in the FLDB for the machine.  The machine's
        principal name in the Registry Database must match this
        name.
While coding the mkdfs command, we tried two different Registry
principals, neither of which worked:  'hosts/hostname/self' and
'hosts/hostname/dfs-server'.  What did work was work (and this
is what dce_config uses) was 'hosts/hostname', which is not a
Registry principal.
I don't know what is really meant here--I'll leave that to
Transarc or the DFS team to puzzle out.

 In section 2.3.5 (pg. 2-47) of the Application Development Guide,
 the last example at the bottom of the page has an incorrect api call.
 The call should be to sec_key_mgmt_set_key() and not
 sec_key_mgmt_change_key() as documented.   The sec_key_mgmt_change_key()
 does not create a local key file as described, but the sec_key_mgmt_set_
 key() call does.

[06/03/93 public]
Changed to "verified".  Changed the reference from set_key_mgmt_change_key
to set_key_mgmt_set_key in the App Dev Guide chapter overview/chap2.gpsml.  
According to the App Dev Ref page for these two calls, only 
set_key_mgmt_set_key can create a local key file.

rpcd manpage refers to dce.rc instead of rc.dce

DCE Admin Reference
  DCE Remote Procedure Call
    rpcd


> Typically, the RPC daemon starts each time a host boots.  Usually, a

It's rc.dce (not dce.rc) for both OSF and IBM.

[07/08/93 public]
Decided to cancel this CR after consulting with Dave Weisman.  
RPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS is documented in the Porting Guide, and
this should be sufficient, since it is only for developer use.

[07/29/93 public]
I can not make a distinction between RPC_DEBUG appearing in the docs
with a warning and RPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS being treated similarly.
Both environment variables are for development use, both are documented
in the porting guide, and either would result in a big suprise for a 
dce app developer, should he inadvertently use one in an app.  Please
clarify.

[07/30/93 public]
RPC_DEBUG should be moved into the porting guide.
For 1.1, actually, it goes away to be replaced by serviceability code.
Re-opened this defect.

[07/30/93 public]
Hmmm.  My point was that *both* RPC_DEBUG and RPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS should
be in the rpc app dev ref. The typical app developer won't have the porting
guide, but would be singed if he inadvertently used either of these in
an app.

[08/02/93 public]
Yes, I understand your point, and I was trying to correct it:  Both
RPC_DEBUG and RPC_SUPPORTED_PROTSEQS are *not* intended to be available
in DCE production environments.  They are intended for test-use only,
and therefore should be in the P&T guide.

[08/03/93 public]
Reassigned this CR to Doug Weir, the owner of the Porting Guide.

[09/21/93]
Removed RPC_DEBUG from the intro.3rpc reference page. Information about
both variables is already in the Porting Guide.

Page 2-9 of the application development reference lists the names of
the collection of files related to the idl command (see FILES).

included in this list of files is nbase.acf which is not exported/installed
as part of the build/install/configure process. Therefore the document is
not accurate with respect to the presence of this file.

In addition, it appears that the locations of the other files on the list 
are not quite correct. 

The absence of nbase.acf has an effect on DCE aplication stub size which
will be addressed in a companion defect opened against the code (see
Inter-dependent CRs).

DETAILED PROBLEM DESCRIPTION (REQUIRED):
----------------------------------------

Test Delete Replica, assertions CV1601.1 and CV1601.2, perform Show Replica
commands which cause the attribute names to be displayed.  Attribute
RPC_ClassVersion displays both on an AIX server and an OS/2 server, but it is
not listed in the documentation or shown in the examples.

The same is true for Show Directory.  It displays in real life but is not
documented.

REPRODUCE/VERIFY PROBLEM (REQUIRED):
------------------------------------

On the CDSCP command line, type:

cdscp show directory /.:/dir1

Where dir1 is an existing directory.

RELATED INFORMATION (OPTIONAL):
-------------------------------

The OSF documentation, DCE Administration Reference, Section 1, Cell Directory
Service (7/13/92 version) does not show RPC_ClassVersion as an attribute for
Show Replica or Show Directory in either the attribute lists or the examples,
but it displays on both an AIX and OS/2 server.  There are two possibilities:

1. The documentation is in error and should list the attribute and
   include it in the examples.

2. OS/2 and AIX should not display the attribute.
I am writing this defect against the documentation, but please
investigate where the problem lies before changing the documentation
since we really are not sure which is the correct answer.  Thanks!

P.S.
I executed CDSCP Show Replica immediately after refreshing my system in case
something had caused this attribute to be added, but it still displayed.

Assigned this CR to Diana Goldfarb.

[11/18/93 public]

I consulted with Diana Goldfarb and Howard Melman (several times!)
about this CR.

The policy for the cdscp documentation is to describe
the attributes that cdscp can interpret (the CDS_ attributes).
Applications (including DCE) can also create their own attributes;
RPC_ClassVersion is an example of an application-defined attribute
(the DCE RPC NSI code defines it). cdscp can list application-defined
attributes but cannot interpret their values. The documentation for
cdscp show directory explains that the command will include all
attributes, including application-defined ones, in the command output.
The documentation for the cdscp show replica command does not. I have
added this explanatory text to the show replica man page, and am closing
this CR, since the documentation is now consistently correct with
respect to cdscp attribute display and attribute descriptions.

The rpccp program is currently the program to use to interpret
NSI attributes; for 1.0.3, the Application Development Guide,
Section 10.7 "DCE RPC Control Program" has been modified to
explain this in a little more detail.

Full Description:

        Section 11.4.2 (in 1.0.1), is incorrect; the server behavior
        described relates to receiving an exception, not a signal. The
        paragraph begins:

        .P
        To begin listening for remote procedure call requests, the server
        calls \*Lrpc_server_listen(\|)\*O.  This call is placed within the
        \*LTRY\*O
        of a \*LTRY\*O, \*LCATCH_ALL\*O, \*LENDTRY\*O sequence so
        that if the server receives a signal while it is listening, it can
                                    ^^^^^^^^
        unregister its interface and its endpoint before it exits, as
	follows:
        .P

        The marked words should say "an exception" rather than "a signal."
        Also, after the example that follows the paragraph (ending as
	follows)

                 printf("Unregistering endpoint\\n");
                 rpc_ep_unregister(binop_v1_0_s_ifspec, bvec,
                     (uuid_vector_p_t) NULL, &st);

            } ENDTRY;
        }
        .oE

        it would be good to add the following:

        Server execution is often terminated using the ctrl-C
        (SIGINT on SVR4) signal. This signal is not trapped by
        the CATCH_ALL clause. Thus, server execution is terminated
        but obsolete end point mappings persist in the end point
        data base.

        To ensure that the server unregisters its interface and its
        endpoints on receipt of a terminating signal, the
        server must declare a handler as follows:


        void handler(signum)        /* SVR4 compliant */
        int signum;
        {
           if(signum == SIGINT)
             {
                rpc_ep_unergister(binop_v1_0_s_ifspec, bvec, NULL, &st);
                exit(0);
              }
         }
         ...    /* server code */

         signal(SIGINT, handler);    /* server must execute this statement*/
                                    /* before going into listen */

Repeat By:

In the man page for the cdscp command "show clearinghouse" are two lists of
attributes.  The second says:

   The following attributes and their values are displayed only when
   you use this command display all attributes and their values

You might want to change this to categorize the following list as counters
instead of attributes, as they are not modifible by the user, but rather
are generated by the server (clearinghouse).   This is the model that is
used for DTS (see show.8dts) where the terms are characteristics and
counters. 

In any case the second list of attributes in the show_clearinghouse.8cds
man page is apparently somewhat out of date.  Below is the output of a show
clearinghouse command:

               Read Accesses = 151
              Write Accesses = 8
         References Returned = 0
    Root Not Reachable Count = 0
       Data Corruption Count = 0
              Skulk Failures = 0
         Entry Missing Count = 0
       Upgrades Failed Count = 0
                     Enables = 1
                    Disables = 0


Below is what the documentation says (notice that they don't match):

      The following attributes and their values are displayed only when you
      use this command to display all attributes and their values:

      Data Corruptions    Specifies the number of times that the data
                          corruption event was generated

      Enable Counts       Specifies the number of times that the
                          clearinghouse was enabled since it was last
                          started

      Read Accesses       Specifies the number of read operations directed
                          to this clearinghouse

      References Returned Specifies the number of requests directed to
                          this clearinghouse that resulted in the return of
                          a partial answer instead of satisfying the
                          client's request

      Skulk Failures      Specifies the number of times that a skulk of a
                          directory, initiated from this clearinghouse,
                          failed to complete- usually because one of the
                          replicas in the replica set was unreachable

      Times Clearinghouse Entry Missing
                          Specifies the number of times the
                          clearinghouse entry missing event was generated

      Times Root Not Reachable
                          Specifies the number of times the root
                          lost event was generated

      Upgrades Failed Counts
                          Specifies the number of times that upgrades
                          failed

      Write Accesses      Specifies the number of write operations directed
                          to this clearinghouse

Licensee reported:

"Full Description:

        We create an object under a test directory and then create a link
        with expiration time set to 20 seconds beyond the creation time
        with the extension time set to 20 seconds. After the expiration+
        extension time we delete the target object and after some more time
        do cdscp show link. The link is supposed to be absent shows up.
        Remember that the convergence of the test directory is set to high."

I did some test with our 1.0.2b23 rios build and found the following:

If the extension is set to 0, the link is supposed to be deleted at the
expiration no matter whether the target exists or not. This does not
happen. After the expiration, the link is still there.

If the extension is non-zero: I delete the target, but the link is not
deleted at the next timeout. Eventually (I set extension to 30 seconds, but
it took about 20 minutes) the link did get deleted.

I think this behavior is wrong. The link should be removed at the
expiration time when extension is 0, or deleted at the next timeout after
the target is removed.

[5/20/93 public]

Doing a directory skulk will cause the link to be removed:

The target is removed, the link is expired, but "show link" indicates that
the link is still there. Now if I do a "set dir ... to skulk" and then
check the link again (show link command), the link is gone (deleted).

[5/26/93 public]
The expiration time on a soft link is merely an indication that the link can 
be deleted after that time (if the expiration time is zero). The amount of
time that can pass after the timeout expires and when CDS actually deletes
the link is somewhat indeterminate, but in the current implementation will
be limited to 12 hours or 24 hours for directories with low convergence.

This assumes that your network is not partitioned and that all clearinghouses
holding replicas of the directory containing the soft link are enabled.

If this is not clear from the docs, please turn this into a doc bug; otherwiseplease cancel.

[6/10/93 public]
Checked the dox -- Admin Guide, Cell Directory Service chapter, Creating
a Soft Link section:

The examples are misleading, implying that deletion occurs at the specified
time. It should say *not before* the specified time or *shortly after* the
specified time.

[10/07/93]
Changed explanations of examples to specify that deletion occurs after skulk.

Somewhere in the documentation; either in chapter 10 of the Administration
Guide, or the appropriate page of the Adminstration Reference (describing
cdscp operations on clearinghouses) or both, there should be a note
stating that you must recreate a cleared clearinghouse (i.e reconnect it's
data files to the server) before you can successfully delete the
clearinghouse.

If you try to delete a cleared clearinghouse you will experience the
following.

clear clearinghouse /.:/tmp
cdscp> delete clearinghouse /.:/tmp
Failure in routine: cp_clrdel_clh; code = 282108920
Specified clearinghouse does not exist (dce / cds)

which can be rectified by doing the following

cdscp> create clearinghouse /.:/tmp
cdscp> delete clearinghouse /.:/tmp

Hel found the following problems:

Thinking of dtscp, I find a number of approaches that are problematic:
First, the treatment of the dtsc (sub) commands are confusing to a
first-timer.  There is no reference in Related Information or the
Description section of the dtscp reference page to the fact that you should
see the relevant reference page for more information.  This is particularly
a problem with online access, as the relevant pages are not just a thumb
flip away.  Any administrator who has spent some time would know this
intuitively, of course, but as a neophyte, I got real confused for a while.

Second, I find it interesting that the Intro(8_dts) ref page is really the
introduction to he dtscp command, and NOT to the section, which also
contains the dtsd ref page.  It does not mention the dtsd command.  It is
nearly redundant with the dtscp ref page, except that it explains what the
dtscp commands mean, which the dtscp page does not!  Neither it nor the
dtscp reference page list all the subcommands (exit, quit, help).  Neither
it nor any other page define the timestamp format. (Yes, it is in the guide,
but this should be reference info too. )And there is one reall honest to
god bug in the PH book -- the unadvertise reference page has
"synchorinse(8dts) as the "running" top header.  How much of the above was
intentional?

Finally (and randomly): from dtsd "You can enter the command manually if a
DTS daemon fails to start automatically upon reboot, or if you want to
restart a daemon that you disable and delete to perform a backup or do
diagnostic work."  I understand the logical precedence of the clauses, but
it's something of a mouthful.

The following information needs to be corrected or updated in the DFS ACL
documentation:
o The anonymous identity is changed to nobody.  The uid and gid of nobody are
  both -2.
o The nobody identity is no longer from the local cell.  The identity is now
  a user from a fabricated, unknown cell.
o On a DCE LFS fileset, nobody acquires permissions from the any_other entry
  of an object's ACL.  Because the identity is now a member of a foreign
  (albeit fictitious) cell, it no longer matches on other_obj.
o On a non-LFS fileset, unauthenticated users and all foreign users,
  authenticated or unauthenticated, acquire the other mode bits of an object.
o The "local" cell of an ACL is the local cell of the user who creates the
  ACL, not the cell in which the ACL happens to reside.
o When a foreign user creates an object, the ACL of the object gets a
  foreign_other entry for users from the cell in which the object resides.
  The other_obj entry matches users from the cell of the user who creates the
  object; the foreign_other entry will match users from the cell in which the
  object resides.
  The object also receives a mask_obj (because it has a non_obj entry). 
  Because an unauthed user is technically a foreign user (from an unknown
  cell), the ACL of an object created by an unauthed user also gets a
  foreign_other entry for users from the cell in which the object resides.
o The w permission on an implicit Initial Object Creation ACL will no longer
  be expanded to include i and d (as it is on an implicit Initial Container
  Creation ACL).  The i and d permisions have no meaning for a file, so the
  expansion is pointless.  Note that, if a user explicitly adds i or d to an
  entry on the ACL of a file, the permissions will be maintained.
That summarizes the many changes.  Please excuse the brevity of the summaries.
Correct any blatant errors; thanks.

Over the past few months, DFS ACLs have continued to evolve.  The following
list documents the current changes that need to be made:
 
o The anonymous identity is changed to nobody.  The uid and gid of nobody are
  both -2.
 
o The nobody identity is no longer from the local cell.  The identity is now
  a user from a fabricated, unknown cell.
 
o On a DCE LFS fileset, nobody acquires permissions from the any_other entry
  of an object's ACL.  Because the identity is now a member of a foreign
  (albeit fictitious) cell, it no longer matches on other_obj.
 
o On a non-LFS fileset, unauthenticated users and all foreign users,
  authenticated or unauthenticated, acquire the other mode bits of an object.
 
o The "local" cell of an ACL is the local cell of the user who creates the
  ACL, not the cell in which the ACL happens to reside.
 
o When a foreign user creates an object, the other_obj entry matches users from
  the "local" cell of the user who creates the object, not the cell in which
  the object resides.
 
o The w permission on an implicit Initial Object Creation ACL will no longer
  be expanded to include i and d (as it is on an implicit Initial Container
  Creation ACL).  The i and d permisions have no meaning for a file, so the
  expansion is pointless.  Note that, if a user explicitly adds i or d to an
  entry on the ACL of a file, the permissions will be maintained.
 
o The umask of the process that creates an object is considered only if the
  parent directory of the object does not have the proper Initial Object/
  Container Creation ACL.  Otherwise, it is still considered as documented.
 
In addition, the following text attempts (and, doubtless, fails) to clarify
these changes to DFS ACLs:
 
The DFS documentation does not currently describe ACL inheritance with respect
to file and directory objects created by foreign users. When a foreign user
creates an object, the ACLs of the object are defined with respect to the cell
of the foreign user. The appropriate Initial Creation ACL of the object's
parent directory determines the entries included in the Object ACL of the
object, but the entries in the Object ACL are created with respect to the cell
of the foreign user.
 
For example, suppose a foreign user creates a file in a directory whose Initial
Object Creation ACL grants the following permissions:
 
   user_obj:rwxc--
   group_obj:r-x---
   other_obj:r-x---
 
The Object ACL of the new file inherits these entries directly from the Initial
Object Creation ACL, but the entries correspond to users from the cell of the
user who created the file, not from the cell of the directory in which the file
is created. So the other_obj entry grants r and x permissions to users from the
cell of the foreign user who created the file, not from the cell of the
directory in which the file exists.
 
Similarly, suppose a foreign user creates a subdirectory in a directory whose
Initial Container Creation ACL grants the following permissions:
 
   user_obj:rwxcid
   group_obj:r-x-id
   other_obj:r-x---
 
The Object ACL of the new subdirectory inherits these entries from the Initial
Container Creation ACL, but the entries again apply to users from the cell of
the user who created the subdirectory, not from the cell of the directory in
which the subdirectory is created. Additionally, the subdirectory inherits the
Initial Object Creation and Initial Container Creation ACLs directly from its
parent directory, but the entries in these Initial Creation ACLs correspond to
the cell of the user who created the subdirectory (the same cell to which the
subdirectory's Object ACL corresponds).
 
If the Initial Creation ACL of an object's parent directory contains entries
for users in the cell of the parent directory, the entries are changed to
foreign entries as necessary. For example, suppose the Initial Container
Creation ACL of a new subdirectory's parent directory grants the following
permissions:
 
   user_obj:rwxcid
   group_obj:r-x-id
   other_obj:r-x---
   user:rajesh:rwx---
 
If the subdirectory is created by a foreign user, the entry for the user rajesh
is changed to the following in the Object ACL of the subdirectory:
 
   foreign_user:<cellname>/rajesh:rwx---
 
where <cellname> is the name of the cell with respect to which the parent
directory's ACLs are defined (user rajesh's local cell). The entry for user
rajesh is also changed to a foreign_user entry in the Initial Container
Creation ACL that the subdirectory inherits from the parent directory. The
user entry for rajesh is also changed to a foreign_user entry in the Object
ACL of a new file and in the Initial Object Creation ACL inherited by a new
subdirectory if the parent directory's Initial Object Creation ACL contains
such a user entry.
 
Foreign entries (foreign_user, foreign_group, and foreign_other) are usually
inherited directly from the appropriate Initial Creation ACL; they are not
typically manipulated during inheritance. Thus, you can include a foreign_other
entry on a directory's Initial Creation ACLs to ensure that users from the
cell with respect to which the ACLs are defined are automatically granted
permissions on an object created in the directory by a foreign user. For
example, suppose the Initial Container Creation ACL in the previous example
also included the following entry:
 
   foreign_other:<cellname>:rwx---
 
where <cellname> is the name of the cell with respect to which the parent
directory's ACLs are defined. A subdirectory created in the directory inherits
this foreign_other entry, unchanged, directly from the parent's Initial
Container Creation ACL. With two exceptions, this inheritance is true of all
foreign entries, regardless of the local cell of the user who creates an
object.
 
The sole exceptions occur when a foreign_user or foreign_group entry defined
with respect to the cell of a foreign user who creates an object exists in the
appropriate Initial Creation ACL. In this case, the foreign entry is changed
to a local entry in the ACLs of the new object because the foreign entry is a
local entry in the cell with respect to which the new object's ACLs are
defined. For example, suppose the Initial Container Creation ACL in the
previous example also includes the following entry:
 
   foreign_user:<foreign_cellname>/mike:rwx---
 
where <foreign_cellname> is the name of the cell of a foreign user who creates
a subdirectory in the directory. When the foreign user from the named cell
creates the subdirectory, the foreign_user entry for mike is changed to a user
entry on the subdirectory's Object ACL because it is now defined with respect
to the same cell as the subdirectory's Object ACL (mike's local cell). So the
previous entry would be changed as follows:
 
   user:mike:rwx---
 
The entry is changed in the same way in the Initial Container Creation ACL that
the subdirectory inherits from the parent directory. The same changes are also
made to the Object ACL of a file created in the directory and to the Initial
Object Creation ACL inherited by a new subdirectory if the parent directory's
Initial Object Creation ACL includes such a foreign_user entry.
 
In the case where a directory does not have the appropriate Initial Creation
ACL, the umask of a user who creates an object in the directory is used as the
basis of the Object ACL of the object. An Object ACL is explicitly created for
an object created by a foreign user, even if the object's parent directory does
not have the appropriate Initial Creation ACL. Entries on the explicit ACL are
associated with the cell of the user who creates the object, not with cell of
the object's parent directory.
 
Note: Initial Object Creation and Initial Container Creation ACLs are never
      created for a subdirectory whose parent directory does not have the
      corresponding Initial Creation ACLs. Also note that the umask is never
      used to determine the ACL permissions granted by an object whose parent
      directory has the appropriate Initial Creation ACL.
 
I hope this information helps to clarify things; documentation changes will be
based on the text of this note.

Another ACL issue that needs to be resolved and documented pertains to changing
the default realm (cell) of an ACL.  The acl_edit command provides an interface
for changing an ACL's default realm.  We need to determine who can change the
default realm of an object ACL and an initial ACL.  We also need to think about
just what it all means (should inital ACLs be allowed to have different default
realms than the object ACL of their corresponding object) and how it really
should work.  The related code work is presently under consideration.

In the list of staus's in the show(8dts) man page, the last item is uid.
There is a newline after the .LI in the source file so the uid is indented
too far.  Since there is an indented list before this item, the uid appears
to be in that list as opposed to being its own status.

The following paragraph appears in the Security Module of the 
DCE Admin Guide, chapter "Creating and Maintaining Accounts", section 
"A Note About Ticket Lifetimes":

    The Default Certificate Lifetime cannot be less than the Minimum
    Certficate Lifetime nor greater that the Maximum Certificate 
    Lifetime.  If you enter a value for Default Certificate Lifetime
    that does not fall in the minimum/maximum range, that value will
    display (in the rgy_edit view subcommand) as the number you entered,
    but the effective Default Certificate Lifetime will be lengthened
    or shortened to fall within the minimum/maximum range.

I find this to be false.

If I set the Default Certificate Lifetime to be 2m and leave the
Minimum Certficate Lifetime as 5m, then view the values, I see 2m
as the default and 5m as the min (as advertised).

Next, I dce_login as cell_admin and do a klist.  The tkt lifetimes
are shown to be 2m, not 5m:

So, either the documentation is incorrect, or some registry
policy/properties mechanism that validates the Default Certificate
Lifetime is missing or not working properly.

[5/03/93 public]
There is at least one instance in which having a Default Certificate Lifetime
less than or equal to the Minimum Certificate Lifetime breaks functinality.
This is the rgy_edit "site" subcommand as described in the scenario below:

(1) Configure cellA and cellB, including gda.
(2) Use the rgy_edit "cell" subcommand to set up a peer trust relationship.
(3) In cellA, set the Default Certificate Lifetime = 2m (which is shorter than
    the default Minimum Certificate Lifetime, 5m).
(4) In cellA, re-dce_login then issue the rgy_edit "site" subcommand, specifying
    /.../cellB
    ==> function fails with the infamous "Registry Server Unavailable" message
(5) In cellA, set the Default Certificate Lifetime = 5m (equals the default
    Minimum Certificate Lifetime).
(6) In cellA, re-dce_login then issue the rgy_edit "site" subcommand, specifying
    /.../cellB
    ==> function fails as before
(7) In cellA, set the Default Certificate Lifetime = some value greater than the
    Minimum Certificate Lifetime.
(8) In cellA, re-dce_login then issue the rgy_edit "site" subcommand, specifying
    /.../cellB
    ==> function succeeds.

I gathered some security debug output and found that the
rpc_binding_set_auth_info() call in rca_setup_handle() failed with an error of
KRB5KDC_ERR_NEVER_VALID.  This can be returned from do_as_req.c or do_tgs_req.c
when the requested tkt lifetime is too short.


Per Bill Sommerfeld, The documentation is wrong and should be modified to 
reflect the relationship as described in the comment and code below.
Taken from kdb_rsdb.c, in the routine krb5_dbm_db_get_policy():

        /* We enforce the ordering:
         *
         * 60 seconds <= default
         * 60 seconds <= max
         * 60 seconds <= max_renewable
         * min <= default <= max <= max_renewable
         */

        max_life = max (60, max_life);
        max_renewable_life = max (60, max_renewable_life);
        default_life = max(60, default_life);

        max_life = min (max_life, max_renewable_life);
        default_life = min (default_life, max_life);
        min_life = min (min_life, default_life);

The create and enable commands to dtscp are completely confusing.  They are
documented in the create(8dts) enable(8dts) and intro(8dts) man pages and
say things like "The create command, which establishes a DTS entity".  I
have no idea what establishing a DTS entity means.  Or "The create command
creates a time server or time clerk entity on the system where the command
is entered."  What is creating a time entity mean?  Does this command
invoke the dtsd process? (no it doesn't, although the delete command will
stop a running dtsd process!).  The enable command says it "starts a DTS
entity", does this mean it invokes the process? (no, it means the endpoint
gets registered with the rpcd).

Please change the descriptions of these command to be understandable using
simple little words :-)

Also, all of the of the control programs have their own man pages, but some
also have man pages for each command.  dtscp is one of these.  It of all
the control programs doesn't need this.  All of them could be combinded
into one man page (and the show and set commands could avoid duplication).

Section 7.1.2 "Password Lifespan" includes the sentence:

  Users must change their passwords when they expire.

This is unclear to me.  Do they have to change them BEFORE they expire, or
can they change them after they expire.  If they can't login when they
expire how can they change their password?  What if they are logged in when
the password expires?  Are they still logged in, and change they change
their password at this point?

Also, when does the password actually expire?  After n days from when the
password is created, or at 12:01am on the day that it expires?

Finally, the text should include a sentence saying with what command users
can change their passwords.

[04/29/93 public]
No no no, the antecedent for "they" is "Users." :-)

[4/29/93 public]
The same comment (the bug not the grammer correction :-) applies to section
7.1.3 "Password Expiration Date" as well.

[7/13/93 public]
The wording wasn't explicit enough that it couldn't be explicit, so it's
being reworded with a better explanation, with expletive's deleted.  As the
doc says now: it is up to the vendor's implementation how this is handled.
Unfortunately, it only says the mechanism is up to the vendor (which does
answer your question about when), but doesn't yet explain that the policy
(whether to adhere to strict passwd-change requirements, or not to use
the feature at all) is also up to the vendor to exploit.  Before we get into
an explosive situation, let's explore an example (can you tell I need a
vacation? :-)

Vendor A may implement a login program that would not allow you to log in,
until you entered a new password (twice) after correctly entering the expired
password.
Vendor B may implement a login program that logs you in and invokes the passwd
change program if the password had expired, but doesn't enfore the change (ie:
you could break out of the passwd change program).
Vendor C could ignore the 'reset_passwd' flag that comes back from the API
altogether, if they didn't care about password expirations.

The point is that the password expiration policy is advisory only at the API
layer (and there is no supported login program shipped with DCE from the OSF)
so it's up to each vendor to decide what their customers need.

[7/16/93 public]
I changed the wording in all the appropriate places to say that 
the policy to handle expired passwords and the mechanism to do 
it is defined for each platform. Changes reviewed by Mike Burati.

[melman 4/29/93 public] 

Section 7.1.5 is titled: "Handling Contradictory Registry, Account, and
Organization Standard Polices".  This is wrong, since standard policies can
only be set for the registry as a whole and for individual organizations.
A better title would be: "Handling Conflicting Standard Policies".  The
text of the section properly mentions only organizations and registry
standard policies.

Section 7.1.6 was created for CR 3301.  It has poor grammer.  The confusion
lies in the phrase password format policy.  This is a collective term that
refers to three separate policies.  Better would be to use password format
policies.   The example in the middle of the second paragraph either needs
the word `the' added before the phrase `password format policy' or it
should be changed to read `the minimum password length policy'.

In section 3.4, table 3-1 the description of UNIX number mentions that you
can enter a number lower than the low unix number set with the rgy_edit
prop command.  It should mention that this is the unix low number for
principals (there are other for groups and orgs that can be set by rgy_edit
prop) 

In section 3.5.2, table 3.2 the description of UNIX number was just cut and
pasted from the principal table description.  The first sentence needs to
change from "The required UNIX ID associated with the principal" to
something that mentions groups and organizations.  Also this description
should be modified as above to mention the low group uid and the low
organization uid.

In section 7.3.3 "Low UNIX ID Property" it should mention that there are
separate low unix ids for principals, groups, and orgs.  The examples in
sections 7.3.7.1 and 7.3.7.2 properly show this.

The users guide in the description of acl_edit only barely mentions the
mask_obj and unauthenticated masks.  In three places it gives the same
information (section 4.2.2, 4.7 and 4.12.1-2).  No mention is made of the
-n and -c switches on the modify command that recompute masks when
necessary, what recomputation entails, why some acls need it and some
don't, what the difference is between -n and -c, etc.  The purge command is
also involved in masks and it is not described well.

I do see that the purge command is in table 4-3 and that -n and -c are
listed in table 4-1, but I think that a complete discussion of masks and
the operations on them (and examples of DCE objects with masks) deserves an
entire section.

It appears that the mask_object acl entry type is not supported by either
the cds or registry acl managers. If this is true, then this should be made
clear in the description of the mask_obj. The cds acl manager's supportted
acl entry types are listed on page 7-4 of the dce1.0.2 Core Componet Admin
Guide.

Reassigning this CR to Peter Neilson, OSF ACL management writer.
Peter is revising the chapter that describes how to manipulate ACLs
with acl_edit (formerly in the User's Guide and Reference,

how to manipulate them with dcecp. This CR impacts that work
(i.e., how to handle masks with dcecp, instead of with acl_edit).

The Description of acl_edit in both the users guide and the reference page
needs to clearly describe the fact that there is a transaction model in
use, and that none of the changes made to an acl during an acl_edit session
are saved to the object until the user invokes either commit or exit.  Also
that abort can be used to exit the session without saving the changes.
These commands are listed in the reference page, but the use model should
be described in the the DESCRIPTION section of the reference page.

the fact that it is possible for PACs to be sent unencrypted if
there is no protection level used in an RPC call.  This needs to
be made clear in the documentation.

The relevant notes from the discussion follow:

Joe:

Recall the following question I posed, and answer you provided:


    2) I still don't understand how the authn flag of a PAC could be false.

In the current implementation, there is no way to obtain a PAC from the runtime
that has the authentication flag set to FALSE.  This is because the current
protocol sets don't allow "authz_dce" to be requested unless an authentication
protocol and protection level have been requested.

Well, I found that my trials contradict the theory that you can't specify
authz_dce unless an authentication protocol and protection level have been
specified. Here's the trial:

1) Client annotates security as:
         rpc_binding_set_auth_info( binding_h,
                                   svr_princ_name,
                                   rpc_c_protect_level_none,
                                   rpc_c_authn_dce_secret,
                                   NULL  /*use default security login context
                                        from current addr space*/ ,
                                   rpc_c_authz_dce  /*authz based on client
                                        PAC*/ ,
                                   &status);
        NOTE: Protect_level_none, with authn_dce_secret, and PAC based authz.

RESULT of client calling server who registered for authn RPC:
-----
clouseau-> mygreet_server /.:/dce_users/jal/mygreet
Listening ...
authn_svc is rpc_c_authn_dce_secret
Protect level none
authz_svc is rpc_c_authz_dce
client_privs are
Client UUID 00000079-345F-2AF5-BA00-8060809C0000
Principal Name from uuid pkqjs  (I had to call sec_rgy_pgo_id_to_name. Could
                                 not print pac->principal.name. Got "(null)")
Not a certified PAC!
The mygreet client says: hello, mygreet server

SO.. PAC is transmitted but not certified! Is PAC passed in plain text?
Is the PAC issued by the Privilege Svc? 
No encryption of PAC? So no  key exchange occuring for authenticated RPC?

Is this a bug?

Jeannine,

You are right, I mis-typed (and forgot).

pato> protocol sets don't allow "authz_dce" to be requested unless an 
pato> authentication protocol and protection level have been requested.

I should have left out "protection level".  You can, in fact, get a PAC that is
marked unauthenticated if the protection level is set to protect_level_none.   

    SO.. PAC is transmitted but not certified! Is PAC passed in plain text?
    Is the PAC issued by the Privilege Svc? 
    No encryption of PAC? So no  key exchange occuring for authenticated RPC?

In general, the PAC is obtained from the privilege server and is certified in
the normal way.  However, since there is no protection level being used on the
given RPC call, there is no way for the server to validate that the PAC has
been certified.  The PAC is in fact just transmitted in the clear - no ticket
or authenticator is exchanged, no session key is established.  Therefore, it is
possible for the client to have forged the PAC.

    Is this a bug?

No, the server is clearly informed that the PAC was not authenticated
(certified).  If you want the PAC to be transmitted securely, then you must
select protect_level_call.

Although not a bug, this fact should be CLEARLY documented. It is not.
The documentation states that chossing PAC based authz guarentees a certified
PAC from the privilege svc.

Subject: follow ques to prot level

Joe,

I've thought of a followup question to your mail regarding protection level:

----- begin included text -------

In general, the PAC is obtained from the privilege server and is certified in
the normal way.  However, since there is no protection level being used on the
given RPC call, there is no way for the server to validate that the PAC has
been certified.  The PAC is in fact just transmitted in the clear - no ticket
or authenticator is exchanged, no session key is established.  Therefore, it is
possible for the client to have forged the PAC.
 
    Is this a bug?
 
No, the server is clearly informed that the PAC was not authenticated
(certified).  If you want the PAC to be transmitted securely, then you must
sselect protect_level_call.

----- end included text --------

Can't you use protect_level_connect to transmit the PAC securely? In this
case the pac is sent encrypted the first time the client connects to the
server and is it then stored by server rpc runtime for use in future
calls? No authentication on subsequent calls so can't trust that those
calls are really from client? But is PAC available to server manager on
those subsequent calls?

How often is PAC sent? Does it depend on prot_level?

Additionally, I've given more thought to the issue of whether the
requirement for a certain protect_level to achieve authenticated rpc 
is a bug or not. It seems logical that should NOT be able to specify 
authn_dce_secret and a prot_level of none in the rpc_binding_set_auth_info
call, if the prot_level_none negates the authn_dce_secret. DCE should
return an error of incompatible options specified in the call. Else,
the naive dce user can falsely believe authenticated rpc is occurring
when it is not!

Subject: Re: DCE client identity
Date: Tue, 30 Mar 93 12:19:01 -0500

In an attempt to stamp out misinformation:

DCE RPC encrypts the name in name-based authorization *exactly* when
it would generate a certified PAC in PAC-based authorization.

The comments in rpcbase.idl explain it quite succinctly:

const long rpc_c_protect_level_default         = 0; /* default for auth svc */
const long rpc_c_protect_level_none            = 1; /* no authentication performed */
const long rpc_c_protect_level_connect         = 2; /* only on "connect" */
const long rpc_c_protect_level_call            = 3; /* on first pkt of each call */
const long rpc_c_protect_level_pkt             = 4; /* on each packet */
const long rpc_c_protect_level_pkt_integ       = 5; /* strong integrity check */
const long rpc_c_protect_level_pkt_privacy     = 6; /* encrypt arguments */

If you give a "protect_level_none", you get no authentication, but
uncertified authorization information *may* be passed along to the
server.  This information should not be trusted under any
circumstances, though it could be useful for
debugging/tracing/measurement purposes in a "friendly" network.

In an ideal world, there would be a function provided by DCE which
takes a server binding handle, an in-memory ACL representation, and a
needed set of permissions and returns a thumbs-up/thumbs-down
indication.  *IT* would do the rpc_binding_inq_auth_client call and
interpret the various authentication services/levels/etc with respect
to the acl, including the "unauthenticated mask", reducing the chance
of the server author making a mistake in interpreting the complicated
credentials coming in off the wire.  It would also be an obvious place
to put in the interpretation of any new delegation/role/
phase-of-moon/etc acl entry types to ensure that all DCE services
interpret ACLs in a consistant way.

Unfortunately, it doesn't exist now (I vaguely recall arguing for it
early on in the design stage but was vetoed, for a reason I still
don't fully understand).

[4/24/93 public]

I have been doing some experimentation with RPC timeout values.  I have been
setting the timeout value of the rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout() routine, in a
client application, and then charting the time (in secs) that an RPC takes
to timeout, in the absense of a server.  I have done this for both DG and CN.

The client is a very simple application.  It creates a binding handle with
an endpoint (ie no cdsd/rpcd necessary).  The protseq, ip addr, and endpoint
are passed in on the command line.  A TRY/CATCH is put around the call, and
a timer is set up to count (in secs) how long the call takes to return.

I ran the client, setting the com timeout of the rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout()
routine to all values, 0-10.  Here is the data I got, when I subsequently
attempted to make an RPC to a server that did not exist:

DATAGRAM
--------

timeout value       timeout (in secs)
      0                    5
      1                    5
      2                    9
      3                   13
      4                   20
      5                   35
      6                   65 (1m 5s)
      7                  125 (2m 5s)
      8                  245 (4m 5s)
      9                  485 (8m 5s)
     10                  doesn't timeout

CONNECTION-ORIENTED
-------------------

timeout value       timeout (in secs)
      0                   75
      1                   75
      2                   75
      3                   75
      4                   75
      5                   75
      6                   75
      7                   75
      8                   75
      9                   75
     10                  doesn't timeout

So it looks like the timeout value doesn't matter for connection-oriented
RPC, unless you choose 10 (attempt to connect forever).

Other notes of interest for CN RPC, where the client attempts to connect
to a server that isn't there:

* If the ip address in the binding handle is on the local net, and the host
  DOES exist, the RPC will always return immediately with the exception
  rpc_x_connect_rejected, no matter what the timeout value of
  rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout() is set to.

* If the ip address is on the local net, but the host DOES NOT exist,
  the RPC will always return immediately with the exception
  rpc_x_connection_closed, no matter what the timeout value of
  rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout() is set to.

* If the ip address is not on the local net, and the host DOES NOT exist,
  the RPC will always timeout after 75 seconds, no matter what the timeout
  value of rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout() is set to, unless the value is set
  to 10 (attempt to connect forever).

Is this the designed behaviour?  I have seen nothing documented to indicate
that this is/isn't what I should expect to see.

[4/26/93 public]

Under what conditions did you see the results in the table above?   Are these 
the results from running the tests in the setup described under the third '*',
or from some other setup?

Yes, the results in the table above are from running the tests in the setup
described under the third '*'.  

The 75 second timeout only happened when you sent the RPC off into
"no mans land".

[4/28/93 public]

This is the expected behavior for CN RPC.  These values were originally
set up for DG since it does retransmissions, etc.  Also, note that the
man pages were pretty vague about how these values are interpreted.

CN RPC looks at the timeout value you enter as a binary value.  If you've
selected infinite timeout, then we'll try forever.  Otherwise, we will
try once and rely upon the underlying transport to perform any retries.
However, even in those cases where the user advises us to retry forever,
we won't if we get a "hard" error.

In terms of relative timings, 
CN RPC will timeout faster in those cases where the transport
can detect the situation faster.  (e.g., machine is up, but the server
is not.)

[4/28/93 public]

The manpage partially describes this situation:

	Depending on the protocol sequence for the specified binding
	handle, the <timeout> value acts only as advice to the RPC runtime.
	
I'll change this OT to a DOC enhancement; it should provide a bit more
detail as per Wei's comments above.

The Release Notes for 1.0.2 say that deleting a read-write fileset also
deletes any read-only replicas of the fileset. Using b23 in a 2 pmax
cell, fts lsfldb tells me the read-only replica is still there, it's
only when I create a mount point and try to access it that I find out
otherwise. Can we make this a little more clean? ie. have the fldb
reflect the true state (exists or doesn't) of the read-only replica?

[4/16/93 public]
This is an essentially cosmetic message; as I understand what's going on
here, the CM then proceeded to allow access to the read-only fileset that
really was on dce5.osf.org.
 
The message should probably be changed to ``Fileset is not managed by
repserver'' or some such.  The release-style replica still exists even
after deleting the R/W fileset, but the cache manager can't find out anything
interesting about it from the repserver.  I'm a little surprised that the
CM thought it could.
 
I believe that the release note mentions that it's only repserver-managed
replicas (all replicas for scheduled replication, all but the staging
replica for release replication) that are deleted when the R/W is deleted.
The replica in question for this OT is in fact the staging replica for
release replication, so it wasn't deleted.
 
I understand that the problem alluded to in the release notes, that
repserver-managed R/O filesets are deleted when the R/W is deleted, still
exists as a problem.

Actually, the CM did NOT proceed to allow access to the read-only fileset -
but other than that, you're on the money.

[4/16/93 public]
I read that report about code 648998915 from the earlier part of the report.
What happened after that?  What error (if any) was reported?  Anything
on the machine console?
[4/16/public]
Nada - nothing on the console, nothing in the var/dfs/adm/*Logs. Unfortunately,
I didn't do an lsheader before cleaning up after this. I'll try the steps
again to see how reproducable this is.

[4/16/93 public]
So the CM just hung your shell, so it never gave a prompt?
Had you done ``fts release'' on this fileset?  That is, had there ever been
an epi.1.readonly fileset?  (Regardless of what the fldb says?)  Thanks.
[4/16/public]
The CM didn't hang my shell, I just wasn't allowed to cd to the mount point
for the read-only fileset. I'm afraid I did leave out some relevant details
though - upon retrying all this with epi.2 :

[4/16/93 public]
CORRECTION: in both cases (original epi.1 case and current epi.2 case), I AM
able to cd to the read-only mount point. So, this request is a cosmetic one,
lowering the priority.

[7/29/93 public]
After talking to Craig and Elliot about this issue, here is what we have 
decided: The heart of the problem, deleting a rw fileset should not 
delete its read-only replicas, will be fixed among other replicas-related 
works in ot2890. 
                                                                             
Until the enhancement is done, deleting a RW fileset will also deletes 
its read-only replicas as described in 102 Release Notes. However, the Release
Notes failed to mention that the status flag regarding the read-only 
replicas stored in FLDB is not valid any more. 
Change this defect to a DOC defect and change the 102 document to describe the 
situation.

I included the following text in the DCE 1.0.2A Release Notes:
 
   "The DCE 1.0.2 Release Notes for the State of the DCE DFS Code report that
    if you remove the read/write version of a DCE LFS fileset, the appropriate
    Replication Servers automatically remove all read-only versions of the
    fileset. This information is still true. However, it should also be noted
    that the status flag for the read-only replicas of the fileset in the
    fileset's FLDB entry remains valid, even though all read-only replicas
    have been removed. The status flag continues to be valid because the
    replication sites are still defined, not because replicas exist at those
    sites."
 
The information in this note was verified by Tu here at Transarc.  Larry
Kaplan at OSF graciously agreed to incorporate the text in the 1.0.2A
Release Notes.  This one can now be closed.

From Howard's FAQ - Pam, should some of this be added to the
Admin Guide?  In particular, noting that it's not the user's
password that gets transmitted and stored in the registry,
but rather a DES key.

Subject: SEC: Encryption vs Hashing
Date: Mon, 22 Feb 93 14:22:00 -0500

Jonathon, I'll wing an answer without looking into any references, so I
may be slightly wrong but not by very much.

> Could you enlighten me on the encryption vs. hashing? Specifically:
> (a) when I look at the 13 characters in the 2nd field in /etc/passwd,

"Encryption" refers to an invertible process (namely, "decryption"),
based on a key.  "Hashing" (= "checksumming" = "one-way function" =
"fingerprinting", etc.) refers to a non-invertible process, with or
without a key being involved.  References: The DES spec and the MD5 spec
(the latter is Internet RFC 1321).

(a) The first 2 characters are the "salt" (in plaintext), which select
one of 4096 (I think it is) "variations" of DES (these variations are
non-standard because they twist some S-boxes, I think -- it's intended
to effectively expand the DES keyspace, making an exhaustive key search
harder).  The algorithm then crunches the user's password into a 64-bit
DES key (or maybe uses it directly, Unix passwds being so short), and
uses that key to encrypt the null DES block 25 times (using the DES
variation selected by the salt -- again, the 25 times are an attempt to
show down DES, making guessing attacks), and that's what the other 11
characters are (64 random bits -> 11 ACSII characters).  This is
obviously a hashing of the password, not an encryption.

(b) The Rgy doesn't store passwords, it stores DES keys.  As above, the
user's password is crunched, locally on the client (I don't remember the
algorithm used in Unix, but in Kerberos/DCE the crunching is a
"fan-fold" algorithm -- see the Kerberos spec).  It's the key that's
used in the authentication exchange, not the password.

Changed "Fix By Baseline" from 1.0.3 to 1.1.

[9/23/93 public]
Fixed and verified.  Note that we did not define 
encyrption vs. hashing, but we did clarify how the 
principal's password is used to derive the auth key 
and how the keys are used for authentication.  
(Note that a detailed description of authentication 
is in the Application Development Ref.) Verified by

Subject: ODE: Building DCE with NFS
Date: Fri, 18 Dec 92 14:14:54 -0500


Howard:

	At this morning's SIG meeting, you mentioned that we are working on the
NFS mount DCE build, and the rats people are having some porblem with it in
GDS area.

	I don't know whether they have found the cause of the problem, but I
had some experience buildin gDCE with nfs mounted fs before. I sent out some
infomration back in the summer.

	If the problem is that in the middle of the build, it hangs in gdskiss,
then we are talking the same problem:

	There is a file lock in gdskiss (alos in one of the thread tests, if my
memory still serves, I was having the problem in both areas at that time). The
file lock is implemeted through lockd daemon. If the file is located on a NFS
mounted file system, the lockd will contact lockd and statd on the other
machine. If the other machine is not running lockd and/or statd, the local
lockd will hang forever. You cannot even kill the process since it is still in
the kernel mode.

	I was mounting an AIX partition on the sparc. Once I started lockd
and statd on the rs6000, everything works. Later I needed to mount a partition
from a PMAX running OSF/1, I could not do it since OSF/1 does not have lockd
and/or statd. I sent out a mail to dce-team about this, and got a reply from an
OSF/1 guy saying that he just found the same problem. Naturally I asked how he
solved the problem. The answer was he switched to local disk.

In both the DFS Admin Guide section and the Admin Ref man page
for the cm sysname command, the examples for AIX 3.2 are wrong.
The current examples show that when you run "cm sysname" on
an AIX 3.2 machine the output is "Current sysname is 'aix32_rs';
the output actually is 'rs_aix32'.  
All references to aix32_rs should be changed to rs_aix32.

The source example referenced above is in the DCE source tree, so you can't
put that in the APP dev guide because it's up to vendors whether to provide
examples or not, and they will be in a different place if they do.  Even so,
it's still an example use, not "exist in code form" as mentioned above.
This is all going to change for 1.1 because Rich Salz is working on a 
replacement for this internal API.  Rich, please comment on what you think
should be done about this documentation.

[08/20/93 public]
I think we should drop the sec_acl_mgr_xxx documentation and consider
it to be totally replaced by the 1.1 ACL library.  There will be
a DCE-RFC shortly.  There is a chance that the 1.1 ACL library won't
be a public facility in 1.1, so don't cancel this OT quite yet...

[9/16/93 public]
I've changed this to an enhancement so that it will not be lost.  
As an enhancement it will be reviewed for 1.1.  At that time we 
will know if the ACL library made it into 1.1.

[8/31/94 public]
Fixed and verified.
As a special favor to rsalz, defuncted the sec_acl_mgr calls.

From: weisman@osf.org
To: dce-team
Subject: SEC: Security Client Folklore
Date: Thu, 16 Apr 92 16:01:55 -0400

Tom Lemaire had a fun problem while trying to dce_login on a security
client machine.  

Symptoms:

1) He could dce_login normally on the server machine.

2) Any attempt to login from the client machine resulted in:
	"Password Validation Failure."

The final problem was due to the time clocks on the machine being
approximately one hour our of sync.  The server machine thought it was
around 1400 and the client thought it was around 1500.

Because of the skew, Kerberos returned an error to
sec_login_validate_identity.

The "Password Validation Failure." message from dce_login was due to an bug
in its error handling (OT 2817).  Unfortunately the real Kerberos error is
not much more descriptive.

The information below is from Howard's FAQ.  Info needs to be
added to the User's Guide to explain to users how to change
their passwords using rgy_edit (instead of chpass).  The
admin guide (and ref?) need to include information about how the
group and org must be specified before an account can be
changed.  Details follow:

> Are we providing a chpass utility to let users (not admins)
> change passwords and other registry info?  Is it in the tree
> yet? 

The state of chpass has not changed since the end of 1.0.1 when
it was delivered. I have included at the end of this mail a copy
of the drb-request which was submitted for chpass.

About a week or two ago I did raise the issue with Brad that we
are not building the 'sample' programs i.e. login, su, chpass etc.
My understanding is that we won't attempt to build these 
and hence there are no plans to build these utilities.

The change command in rgy_edit does allow users (not just
cell_admin ) to change their password as follows (I just
tested this):

     1. created an account sekhar
     2. dce_login sekhar -dce- 
     3. change -p sekhar -g none -o none -mp new -pw newpasswd
     4. exit
     5. dce_login sekhar newpasswd
     6. successfully logged in

I have not checked to see if all the fields which can be changed
by a user using chpass can also be changed using the change command.

One other issue is that chpass allows a user to specify
whether the information it be changed in the registry database, or
the local override file only or both. Without chpass the only way
a user could change information in the override file would be to 
edit the override file (assuming the location is known to the user).
And editing the file would in turn would most probably require
root access since the passwd_override file should be writable by
root only for obvious reasons.

This is not a request, but a notice for the rest of dce-drb
readers that the following submission is in progress.  It
was pre-approved by Brad, in case I got it done in time for
submission.

CR4767 Drop chpass REFERENCE source (not buildable version).

We are supplying the source for chpass (from bsd4.4) that has
been integrated with the DCE to the point where vendors may
finish the port, and make it buildable.  It is example code,
so we are not supplying a Makefile, and it can not possibly
affect the stability of 1.0.1 at this time.  There are a few
improvements we intend to make to it for 1.0.2 (password
override file manipulation) but wanted to get the sample
version that at least modified pwent information and passwords,
so that much would be usable in 1.0.1 by those vendors willing
to make it buildable on their platform.

The group and org MUST be specified before you can change an 
account. The help command in rgy_edit shows this. I did a quick
check on the Admin Guide which I don't think mentions this.

rgy_edit=> do a
rgy_edit=> help change
           ..... output deleted .....

           REQUIRED:   If -pw or -rp are specified, then -mp must also be
                       specified, to ensure the callers identity.
                       Wildcard password changes are not allowed.  If the password
                       is to be changed, then the principal, group and org must be
                       specified in either interactive mode or via -p -g and -o.

The reason that group and org must be specified is that a principal
can have more than one account and so the user is required to specify
the group and the org to identify THE account where the password
is to be changed. Without the group and org specification either rgy_edit
would have to update the passwords for all accounts or none at all.
And the current policy is that it refuses to update the passwords 
for any account at all. The term Wildcard refers to "all accounts"

This should be documented in rgy_edit subcommands in the Admin Guide
(which I did not see). So could you please open an OT report ? 

Hope this has clarified things.

This is done internally in the CDS pathname parser.  When it recognizes
"/:" it maps to "/.:/fs".  This enables commands like acl_edit and cdscp to
locate DFS.  To see this and much much more, take a look at
cds/library/dnscvtcdsfull.c.
There is also a symbolic link contained in the local file system.  This is
installed by dce_config:
	ln -s $cellname/fs /: >/dev/null 2>&1
This is how <ls> will locate the fs junction point.

Here is a short blurb I put together some time ago.


Nick Dokos	nick@osf.org	
OSF Systems Engineering

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assumptions:

1) Cell running with SEC, CDS, DTS.
2) There is a cell_admin account with the default password "-dce-" that
dce_config establishes. Obvious changes need to be made in what follows
to use a different password.
3) The names of the principals running the server and the client
are tserver and tclient resp. These names are specified in
timop_aux.h as follows:

#define CLIENT_PRINC_NAME	(unsigned_char_t *)"/.../pierrot.osf.org/tclient"
#define SERVER_PRINC_NAME	(unsigned_char_t *)"/.../pierrot.osf.org/tserver"

where "pierrot.osf.org" is the name of the cell.
4) The name of the keyfile as specified in timop_server.h is "/tmp/tkeyfile".
If you change it there, change it in the ktadd below.


Executive summary:
1) Compile the timop programs.
2) Add principals and accounts for tserver and tclient.
3) Add the password of tserver in the keytable.
4) Create an RPC entry object in the name space and
change its ACL so that the server can export its bindings.
5) Run the server and the client.


Procedure:
1) Change timop_aux.h as described above.
2) Compile:

	make -f Makefile.timop

3) Add principals, accounts and keytab entry:

	$ dce_login cell_admin -dce-
	$ rgy_edit
	> domain principal
	> add tserver
	> add tclient
	> domain account
	> add tserver -g none -o none -pw qwerty -mp -dce-
	> add tclient -g none -o none -pw xyzzy -mp -dce-
	> ktadd -p tserver -pw qwerty -f /tmp/tkeyfile
	> quit

Note that the same password should be used in the tserver account
and in the ktadd command.

4) Add RPC entry and change its acl:

	$ rpccp add entry /.:/foo
	$ acl_edit -e /.:/foo -m user:tserver:rwdtc

5) Run the server:

	$ dce_login tserver qwerty
	$ ./timop_server /.:/foo

Wait for the message "Server /:/foo ready."

6) Run the client (in another window):

	$ dce_login tclient xyzzy
	$ ./timop_client /.:/foo

[10/18/93 public]

Changed priority to 1 per Hal Lichtin/Bob Hathaway.

[10/22/93 public]

This is fixed. Incorporated all of the above, plus other information on
building and installing from my personal experience.

[11/11/93 public]

Verified these changes in the latest doc build. These
changes are included with the install/run changes made
in response to CR9136 (there are no separate change
bars that delineate the changes described in this CR).
Consequently, I added CR9136 as a related CR. I am

3. In the NAME section of the disable, enable, and update ref pages it says
   "on the specified node".  All of the DTS commands work only on the local

[4/9/93 public]
According to the DCE manuals (e.g. rpc_ns_binding_import_next(3rpc)) if the
obj_uuid argument of the rpc_ns_binding_import_begin() or
rpc_ns_binding_lookup_begin() operation contains a nil object uuid and, if
the server exported multiple object uuids, rpc_ns_binding_import_next() or
rpc_ns_binding_lookup_next() selects the returned object uuid in a
nondeterministic way. Yet, under these circumstances
rpc_ns_binding_import_next() only seems to return a binding with the first
object uuid of the server entry.

The following piece of code demonstrates the behavior:

===== foo_server.c =====
int main(...)
{

  ...

  uuid_t *object_uuids;
  struct {
    unsigned32 count;
    uuid_t *uuid[100];
  } l_object_uuid_vector;

  ...

  /*  Create the requested number of object uuids and gather them in vector */
  object_uuids = (uuid_t *) malloc(number_of_objects * sizeof(uuid_t));
  for (i = 0; i < number_of_objects; i++) {
    uuid_create(&object_uuids[i], &status);
    l_object_uuid_vector.uuid[i] = &object_uuids[i];
  }
  l_object_uuid_vector.count = i;

  ...

  /* Export bindings to name service */
  rpc_ns_binding_export(rpc_c_ns_syntax_default, cds_pathname, 
			fooif_v1_0_s_ifspec, binding_vector, 
			(uuid_vector_t *) &l_object_uuid_vector,
			&status);

  ...

}

===== foo_client.c =====
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  error_status_t status;
  handle_t binding_h;
  rpc_ns_handle_t import_context;
  unsigned_char_p_t cds_pathname;
  unsigned_char_t *string_binding;

  cds_pathname = (unsigned_char_p_t) argv[1];
  rpc_ns_binding_import_begin(rpc_c_ns_syntax_default, cds_pathname,
			      fooif_v1_0_c_ifspec, NULL, &import_context,
			      &status);
  rpc_ns_binding_import_next(import_context, &binding_h, &status);
  rpc_binding_to_string_binding(binding_h, &string_binding, &status);
  printf("%s\n", string_binding);

  ...

}

The foo_server is run requesting (for example) that 10 object uuids
be created and entered in the server entry. A check with rpccp shows:

rpccp> show server /.:/subsys/foo_server

objects:

  0040f7c2-ab37-1bc5-9248-02608c2f8b6f
  0040fa74-ab37-1bc5-9248-02608c2f8b6f

  00417a30-ab37-1bc5-9248-02608c2f8b6f

binding information:

  <interface id>   0001aacc-7e87-1bc4-9f9d-02608c2f8b6f,1.0
  <string binding> ncadg_ip_udp:130.105.1.135[]
  <string binding> ncacn_ip_tcp:130.105.1.135[]

Yet, a 1000 invocations of the foo_client always returned a binding with
object 0040f7c2-ab37-1bc5-9248-02608c2f8b6f.

[4/12/93 public]

This is intended behavior.  (It was a topic of much discussion when
we were doing it.)  We don't want applications to depend upon
the order in which the object UUID is returned in this case.  However,
we also did not want to do the work to explicitly randomize it.
Hence, we just return the first one.

[4/12/93 public]

If this is intended behavior then I am changing this to a documentation
change request since rpc_ns_binding_import_next(3rpc) and 
rpc_ns_binding_lookup_next(3rpc) state:

	If the server exported multiple object UUIDs, the returned
	binding handle contains one of the object UUIDs. The import-next
	operation selects the returned object UUID in a nondeterministic
	way. So, a different object UUID can be returned for each 
	compatible binding handle from a single server entry.

(as a solution, everything from "The import-next" onward could be omitted
for example).

[5/7/93 public]

Since the above example is not entirely clear and the documentation is not
either, I was wondering about a couple of things.

1) Is intended behavior for the ns_binding_import_next() call supposed to 
   be: a) return the same obj_uuid for a specified binding, or b) is it
   supposed to allow you to loop through using the import_next call and
   return ALL obj_uuids of corresponding if_id and string_binding (one at
   a time of course).

2) If part (b) then, I would like to know how OSF is planning to correct
   the documentation for the two calls since we will have to update ours
   as well, and would like them to remain equivalent.

[07/06/93 public]
Reassigned to writer Steve Lewontin.

[10/12/93 public]

I've added text to both manpages saying:

1) That application should not make any assumptions about the object UUID
returned. 

2) Clarifying, in answer to the above questions, that while a series of
calls is guaranteed to return you all the exported towers, it returns each
tower only once from an entry.  It does not return the cross product of 
towers with object UUIDs.  Hence, you are not intended to get all the
object UUIDs and should not make any assumptions about what object UUIDs you
will get.

All documentation on IDL pipes should make it clear that they exist to
allow for *application*-level optimization of bulk data transfer by
allowing the overlap of communication and processing; the actual data
communications occur at about the same speed as arrays; they only make a
difference for latency (how soon the application sees each "chunk" of data)
and (minimum) memory utilization, not throughput (at least directly;
reducing memory utilization can improve throughput by reducing VM paging).

The intent is that the pipe routines should actually *process* the data and
then get rid of it (i.e., summarize it; write it to a file; put it into a
`struct buf' and immediately wake up another thread to chew on it...),
rather than merely stuff it into an array.

[4/8/93 public]

note above revised slightly.

Comment from mail sent to dce-tech by vic voydock which cites the confusing
section of the document:

===============================================================================
Dick:

Then the DCE documentation should be clarified.  Pipes are defined in the
DCE Application Development Guide, section 17.14.4.  The last paragraph
before 17.14.4.1 states:

... The IDL implementation of pipes in the RPC stub and runtime allows the
apparent callbacks to occur without requiring actual remote callbacks. As
a result, pipes provide an efficient transfer mechanism for large amounts
of data.

Neither here, nor anywhere else that I can find in the DCE documentation,
does it state that pipes are only useful if the data is in "chunks" that
are not all in memory at the same time.

Also, as far as I remember, the various OSF presentations/tutorials did not
make this clear either.

Chapter 7 of the App Dev Guide contains a statement about unhandled
exceptions that (as of 1.0.1, in fact) is no longer true.  The second
paragraph of 7.3.2, Raising an Exception, states:  "If an exception is
unhandled, the thread is terminated.  This provides increased
manageability by confining an error to a well-defined portion of a
program."  I'm not sure the second sentence was ever true, but the
first is definitely outdated.  This should read, "If an exception is
unhandled, the entire application process is terminated.  Aborting the
process, rather than just the faulting thread, provides clean
termination at the point of error, rather than allowing the
disappearance of the faulting thread to cause problems at some later
point."

[is still true in the current 1.0.2doc tree]

        The DCE 1.0.1 Prog. Ref. describes incorrect prototype for the
        rpc_auth_key_retrival_fn_t in the man pages for the interface
        rpc_server_register_auth_info(). Looking at the code tree based
        on Sept. 4, 92, I get the following:

typedef void (*rpc_auth_key_retrieval_fn_t)
(
    [in]        void                    *arg,

rpccp add mapping

Purpose

Adds to or replaces server address information in the local endpoint map.

Synopsis

rpccp add mapping

-i if-id -b string-binding [-b ... ] [ -o object-uuid  [-o ...]] 
   [ -a annotation ] [ -N ]

Options

-i  Declares an interface identifier (required). Only one interface can be 
added in a single operation. If more than one interface is specified, only 
the last identifier is used. The interface identifier has the following form:

interface-uuid,major-version.minor-version

The UUID is a hexadecimal string and the version numbers are decimal strings, 
for example:

-i EC1EEB60-5943-11C9-A309-08002B102989,1.1

Leading zeros in version numbers are ignored. Version numbers are optional, 
but if you omit a version number, the value 0 (zero) is used.

-b  Declares a string binding (required). You must also specify an interface 
identifier (using the -i option). Each command accepts up to 32 -b options.

The value has the form of an RPC string binding, without an object UUID. The 
binding information contains an RPC protocol sequence, a network address, and 
an endpoint as in the following example:


-b ncadg_ip_udp:63.0.2.17[5347]

Note that depending on your system, string binding delimiters such 
te that depending on your system, string binding delimiters such
as [ ] (brackets) may need to be preceded by an \ (escape symbol) or
placed within quotation marks (` ' or " "). Requirements vary from
system to system, and you must conform to the usage rules of a system.

The protocol sequence specified in each binding must be a protocol sequence
that the RPC daemon is listening on (and, implicitly, be a protocol sequence
supported by the RPC runtime on the local host).

-o  Defines an object UUID that further determines the endpoint map elements
that are added (optional). Each add mapping command accepts up to 32 -o options.

The UUID is a hexadecimal string, for example:

-o 3C6B8F60-5945-11C9-A236-08002B102989

-a  Defines an annotation string applied to each cross#product element added
to the local endpoint map. The string can contain up to 63 characters, plus
a null terminating character.

Note that the shell supports quotation marks around the annotation field of
profile elements, which allows you to include internal spaces in an annotation;
the control program does not. To specify or refer to annotations from within
the control program, limit each annotation to an unbroken alphanumeric string;
for example, CalendarGroup. To refer to annotations from the system prompt,
do not incorporate quotation marks into any annotation.

-N  Specifies not to replace a specified interface if the existing version
is greater than or equal to the interface to be added. Use this option when
multiple instances of a server run on the same host. If this option is not
used, and the mapping to be added has an identical (optional) object UUID,
identical interface UUID, identical major version number, and minor version
number equal to or greater than an existing endpoint map element, the
existing element is replaced. If the minor version number is less than the
matched existing element, the provided information is ignored and the
existing element remains unchanged.

Description

The add mapping command adds elements to, or replaces elements in, the local
endpoint map. Each map element corresponds to an interface identifier, binding
information, object UUID (optional), and annotation (optional). The interface
identifier consists of an interface UUID and an optional major and minor
version specifier. The binding information contains an RPC protocol
sequence, a network address, and an endpoint within brackets
(rpc-prot-seq:network-addr[endpoint]).

This command creates a cross#product from the if-id, string-binding,
and object-uuid arguments, and adds each element in the cross#product
as a separate registration in the local endpoint map. This command
requires one interface identifier (the -i option); at least one string
binding (the -b option); and, optionally, one or more object UUIDs
(the -o option). Each instance of the command accepts from 1 to 32 -b
options and from 0 to 32 -o options. If you supply NULL for object-uuid,
the corresponding elements in the cross#product contain a nil oject UUID.

See the rpccp command for more information on rpccp add mapping.

Example

The following command operates from the system prompt to add a map element
to the local endpoint map. The command adds the map element that contains the
specified interface identifier, server address (specified as a string binding),
and object UUIDs.


$ rpccp add mapping \
-i EC1EEB60-5943-11C9-A309-08002B102989,1.1 \
-b ncadg_ip_udp:63.0.2.17[5347] \
-o 005077D8-8022-1ACB-9375-10005A4F533A \
-o 001BC29A-8041-1ACB-B377-10005A4F533A \
-a 'Calendar version 1.1'
$

The previous command adds the following elements:

<object>            005077D8-8022-1ACB-9375-10005A4F533A
<interface ID>    EC1EEB60-5943-1169-A309-08002B102989,1.1
<string binding>  ncadg_ip_udp:63.0.2.17[5347]
<annotation>     Calendar version 1.1

<object>            001BC29A-8041-1ACB-B377-10005A4F533A

CR 8126 had suggested as did this CR that an add mapping page be added.
I had already added the add mapping page to the admin_ref.

However, this CR suggested further enhancements, so I added these to both
the add mapping reference page and the rpccp reference page.

Closed bug.

I understand that filling is supposed to off in the RELATED INFORMATION
section of reference pages.  This is a good thing since filling often makes
these very difficult to read.  rpc_ns_mgmt_handle_set_exp_age.3rpc has
filling on this section as do almost all ref pages in 3rpc, and 3thr as
well.

[5/27/93 public]
Assigned to myself.

[5/28/93 public]
Changed to "verified".  This bug was apparently filed against the
1.0 printed doc, in which filling WAS a problem.  Fill mode seems to
have been routinely turned off during the last Prentice-Hall editorial
review (fall 1992) for all 3rpc and 3thr ref pages.  I found
two ref pages that still had this problem -- pthread_create.3thr and
rpc_sm_allocate.3rpc -- and fixed them.

The -u option of several rpccp commands (show server, show profile, show
entry, unexport; note that this is not an exhaustive list!) has problems
with the last sentence:

    1. It is different across the different man pages
    2. In some cases the word `of' I think should be `if' in order for the
       sentence to make sense, although even that doesn't help a lot.
    3. In some cases the word `option' is incorrectly in bold.

The unexport version seems to be the best.  

In general it "sounds like" rpccp is doing caching.  If so, please use the
word caching instead of `local copy'.

[5/27/93 public]
Assigned to myself.

[06/08/93 public]
Changed to "verified".  Rewrote the entire -u option description with
help from Dave Weisman.  The description is now standard for the six
relevant man8rpc reference pages, and refers to the CDS local cache
instead of simply the "local copy".  I updated the following files
in the man8rpc directory of the Admin Ref:

	rpccp_import.8rpc
	rpccp_show_entry.8rpc
	rpccp_show_group.8rpc
	rpccp_show_profile.8rpc
	rpccp_show_server.8rpc

Full Description:

        In dce/stubbase.h

                #include <dce/pthread_exc.h>

        should be changed to:

                #include <pthread_exc.h>

        This problem causes the idl compiler to fail.
        Note: this bug doesn't cause a problem during the dce build
        because pthread_exc.h is exported to /usr/include/dce while it
        is installed (correctly) in /usr/include.

[3/18/93 public]

I think this is backwards.

pthread_exc.h is a DCE-only sort of thing, unlike pthread.h

It should be installed in /usr/include/dce as a result.

The export tree is correct, the install tree isn't.

[3/18/93 public]
Sounds reasonable to me. If this is the case then the documentation
needs to be changed as well since the man page exceptions.3thr states
that "to use the exception-returning interface, replace #include
<pthread.h> with the following include statement: #include
<pthread_exc.h>". Also I suspect that quite a few other instances of this
exist throughout the code.

[3/18/93 public]

changed to doc bug, area changed to threads.

I'm not sure what you're referring to by "other instances"; different
header files?

[3/19/93 public]

The original intention was to put both pthread_exc.h and exc_handling.h into 
/usr/include.  They aren't DCE-only things, they're CMA-only things.

On Domain/OS, we gave the /src/nosupport/pthreads-exts directory to the group
providing pthreads support.  Naturally, they put these include files into /usr/include
since they are now useable by all applications, not just DCE applications.

This is what we hoped would happen on other platforms.

The following security API routines are incorrectly documented making
application developers change code to port to non 32 bit architectures.
The offending parameters need to be changed from long to match
the generated include file declaration which at the moment is ndr_long_int.

sec_rgy_acct_get_projlist
sec_rgy_pgo_get_members
sec_rgy_pgo_id_to_unix_num
sec_rgy_pgo_name_to_unix_num

The following security API routines are incorrectly documented, but
application portablity is not a problem.

sec_rgy_pgo_get_by_unix_num (long -> ndr_long_int)
sec_rgy_pgo_unix_num_to_id  (long -> ndr_long_int)
sec_rgy_pgo_unix_num_to_name (long -> ndr_long_int)

The following security API routines use an undefined type, byte.  To match
the include file it should say idl_byte.

sec_login_export_context    
sec_login_import_context

[3/18/93 public]
This is a 'doc' bug, not a 'code' bug, so I fixed that above.  There's already
a bunch of CR's (dup'd now) open against the idl files as 'code' bugs.  Pam,
check with us to seen when we're fixing this and exactly what we're going
to use (signed32 or ndr_long_int).

[3/18/93 public]
The documentation is incorrect today.  The include files specify
ndr_long_int.  The bug isn't in the code, it is in the documenation.
If you want to change the code to signed32, thats just peachy,
but it is cosmetic.  Changing the documentation to
match what is done today is what I am looking for.  Without it application
developers will have trouble porting to platforms where ndr_long_int
is not C type long

[06/08/93 public]
Changed "Fix By Baseline" field from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3.

[9/8/93 public]
I made the changes the sec_login_export_context and sec_login_import_context.  
The long to ndr_long_int changes were made under CR 7532.
Status changed to fixed.  This CR should not be verified until 
Security developers finalize plans for idl file changes.

[10/7/93]
The source code changes have been submited to the 1.0.3 tree.
ndr_long_int had been changed to signed32 in the .idl files
( and if it applies ndr_ulong_int -> unsigned32)

[10/21/93 public]
I changed the ndr_long_int to signed32.   I verified this CR 
by looking at the idl files changed by mccann.

[11/11/93 public]

Verified that the byte to idl_byte changes (this CR)
were made in the latest doc build and closed this CR.
(Also verified ndr_long_int to unsigned32 changes (CR7476).)

I believe that the expectations are a little far-fetched.  In particular,
there was already a fileset with ID 0,,4 in the FLDB, and ``syncfldb'' by
definition says to change what's in the FLDB to agree with what's on the
disk.  In this case, what was already on the disk (albeit in the dfstab
file and not in the fileset itself) was a fileset on dce5 with ID 0,,4.
 
Thus, I don't believe that this is a failure, but that it's pilot error:
if there's a fileset with id X on a disk, then invoking syncfldb on that
disk should (and must) update or overwrite the fldb entry for id X.
I don't know of any case in which a free fileset ID will be selected by
syncfldb.  Could we please cancel this one?

I believe the (albeit uninspired) machine names may have caused some 
confusion here. DCE5 has an lfs aggregate with a fileset id from a 
previous fldb. My current fldb has the same fileset id for a ufs aggregate
on DCE12. If I ask that my current fldb be sync'd to include the fileset
info on DCE5's lfs aggregate, shouldn't I get a warning at least that I'm
tromping out/tromped out an existing fldb entry ( in this case, one for
a fileset on a different machine, DCE12)? I could've sworn I'd
seen this type of conflict handled more gracefully by syncfldb before -
ie. the fileset being added whose fileset id is currently in use gets
the next available fileset id. In any event - if syncfldb is documented
to be a "USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - COULD CAUSE DATABASE CORRUPTION" function then,
yes, what I'm asking for is an enhancement - but if not, I think we
should document this OR change the destructive behavior ...
 
NOTE: this happened in a cell whose flservers (dce5 and dce12)
BOTH thought they were the sync site.

[3/18/93 public]
One of the intended uses of this command is to allow you to remove a disk
from a hard-crashed machine and attach it to a working machine, and yet
bring all the data from the disk back on-line as being served by the new
machine.  In doing this, you want to overwrite all the FLDB entries that
pointed to the disk's old location and now point them to this new location
(new server, possibly a new aggregate ID).  That's the kind of repair
that ``fts syncfldb'' is intended to handle, and that's exactly why the
server/aggr information in the FLDB entries is overwritten so freely.
Certainly the doc doesn't say that syncfldb issues warnings and requires
confirmation.  From the 7.11 section of the DFS admin guide:
``The fts syncfldb command....checks the FLDB entry associated with
the fileset to verify that the FLDB correctly records the fileset's status
at the site.  If the FLDB is incorrect, fts syncfldb alters it; if no
entry exists for an online fileset, it creates one.''
 
Apparently, folks have gotten used to re-populating their FLDBs after
a re-configuration by using fts syncfldb, and this should work pretty much
OK (except that any replication information is lost).  It works out
because all the filesets on-line in a cell should have been mutually
consistent.  But, unfortunately, ``fts syncfldb'' isn't a general tool
for gently incorporating aggregates of any source into a DFS installation;
it will in fact overwrite existing data.  It's *meant* to overwrite
existing data.  Perhaps there's a need for a tool to do this kind of
gentle aggregate incorporation, but ``fts syncfldb'' isn't that tool, and
trying to make it into that tool will only keep it from being the kind of
tool that you need to make more gross configuration repairs.
 
I believe that a gentler tool could be built, and could even have been
partially simulated by hand, in that ``fts lshead'' on the newly-attached
aggregate on dce5 would have shown you the filesets that existed there,
and ``fts zap'' would have let you destroy the filesets that you didn't
want before incorporating them into the cell.  What's not built is a tool
to re-number filesets on a disk in preparation for syncfldb, or any kind
of automatic collision-detector that would check that all the filesets
on an aggregate have IDs different from any that are currently in the FLDB.
 
Now, fts syncfldb does have some marginally-friendly behavior, in that if
you're incorporating a fileset that has a fileset ID larger than any
so far allocated in the FLDB, then syncfldb will ensure that the FLDB's
high-water-mark for fileset IDs is increased to accommodate the filesets
to be incorporated.  However, in no case has syncfldb ever re-numbered an
existing fileset (LFS or otherwise) to give it an unused fileset ID.
 
Again, I'm going to ask Jeff K. to take a crack at whether the fts syncfldb
(and fts syncserv) documentation is sufficiently scary that this sort of
behavior should have been acceptable.
Changed Interest List CC from `cfe' to `cfe, jeff@transarc.com'

[3/18/93 public]
You're right Craig - the friendly behavior I thought I'd seen was NOT
renumbering but accepting new/higher fileset id numbers. 
 
I would like to see syncfldb be the single tool for both the "moved" aggregate
case you mention and the "reconfig" or "added" aggregate case I hit most often -
a sysadmin could easily have to move an aggregate from a machine in one
cell to a machine in another cell and not want to delete or renumber by
hand filesets with duplicate fileset ids OR remember to use another tool ...
 
SO ... we can mark this as a doc bug to warn unsuspecting sysadmin's of the
damage they can do - if it's already well doc'd, can we make this a post-1.0.2
enhancement request to make syncfldb friendlier and smarter?

[3/18/93 public]
I vote with Gail.  At the very least, syncfldb should be better 
documented (i.e. with clear warnings about its limited intelligence)
for 1.0.2.  Craig may remember OT4467 which describes problems
I had with syncfldb in the 1.0.1 timeframe that sound an awful lot 
like the problems Gail was seeing except in my case syncfldb blew 
away my root.dfs FLDB entry.  2 folks at OSF have used syncfldb now
and both ran into the same "pilot error".  Sounds conclusive enough
to justify a doc change to me and probably an open OT defect/enhancement 
for 1.0.3.

[3/19/93 public]
Well, I understand that both Ron and Gail have stumbled into similar
disasters with syncfldb overwriting existing fldb entries when importing
essentially-foreign aggregates, and I agree that this is a situation that
should bear some specific warning.  I spoke with Jeff Kaminski, who claims
that the documentation for 1.0.2 froze a while ago and thus it wouldn't
be possible for a warning there, but we can probably all come up with a
release note that addresses the issue, and some kind of suggestion for
work to be addressed in a later release (e.g. 1.0.3).
 
All that granted, though, I don't know how syncfldb could change to handle
both points of view, and I'm afraid I keep wondering how syncfldb came
to be viewed as the tool to use to import foreign aggregates.  As I say,
one could come up with a tool to import foreign aggregates--possibly an
fts sub-function--but its purpose honestly seems to be to be at odds with
the kinds of repairs that syncfldb is supposed to be authorized to do.
Can the OSF offer any enlightenment here, as to how these two functions
are viewed as being such close relatives?  For concrete examples, consider
two cases:
	(a) an LFS fileset with an ID already in the FLDB for a different
	    server/aggregate.
	    (a1) syncfldb overwrites the existing FLDB entry, and has to;
	    (a2) aggregate-import ideally wants to create a new FLDB entry
		 and renumber the LFS fileset with the new ID number, but
		 this might not be possible if the fileset is locally mounted.
	(b) a UFS fileset exported with an ID that's already in the FLDB
	    for a different server/aggregate.
	    (a1) syncfldb, again, overwrites the existing FLDB entry, and
		 has to do that to do its job;
	    (a2) aggregate-import ideally will create a new FLDB entry and
		 request that the administrator edit the server's
		 /opt/dcelocal/var/dfs/dfstab file to match, after first
		 detaching (un-exporting) the UFS aggregate and then
		 re-attaching (re-exporting) it.
 
The whole rationale behind ``syncfldb'' is to say that, for the filesets
on the server/aggregate(s) named in the fts syncfldb command, the
information in the FLDB is wrong and the information on the aggregate(s)
is right.  This is fundamentally different from the foreign-aggregate-import
problem, where an aggregate was created using IDs from some other numbering
system and you now want to import it into a DCE DFS cell.  Is this helping
to clarify my point of view here?  Can the OSF help by telling me how these
two functions are now viewed as so similar?  (Thanks!)

[3/19/93 public]
In general, I feel anything that has a destructive side effect should either
be well documented and/or have a warning and/or require acknowledgement
of the destruction to occur. 
 
I view the two functions as similar because, in both cases, there is
header information that needs to be recorded/reflected in the FLDB. 
I think there'll be plenty of cases where the FLDB is half of what
the sysadmin wants and the aggregate header is the other half ...
 
I believe most system administators will think in terms of all the filesets
they manage, whether in one cell or many, by name and NOT in terms of
cell-specific fileset id's.
 
I believe the 2 functions could be handled if the software DID note
fileset names AND fileset ids and allowed the system admin the option
to alter or overlay name and fileset id conflicts.
 
For instance:
aggregate has:	fileset id 4 for fileset pmax.bin
		fileset id 7 for fileset usr.gmd
		fileset id 10 for fileset user.gail
fldb has:	fileset id 7 for fileset user.gail
		fileset id 4 for fileset pmax.bin on dead server
 
fts syncfldb says:
	id conflict: fileset id 0,,7
	overlay user.gail entry with usr.gmd? (y/n) n
	add new fileset usr.gmd? (y/n) y
fileset 0,,13 created ...
	id conflict: fileset id 0,,4
	overlay pmax.bin entry with pmax.bin? (y/n) y
	name conflict: user.gail
	overlay user.gail id 0,,7 with user.gail id 0,,10? (y/n) n
	add fileset 0,,10 with new name? (y/n) y
	name for fileset id 0,,10 : user.marie
 
You could have an "-y" switch to turn off interactive portion and just
answer "yes" to everything. If it's easier for this to be a separate
tool from synfldb, that's fine with me. Let me know what you think
Craig - you and Tony and Elliot probably have more DFS sys admin experience
than I do.

[3/22/93 public]
Craig and I discussed the fts syncfldb command as it relates to the problem
encountered at OSF.  The documentation can potentially be updated to better
document the somewhat confusing effects of using the command to "move" a
fileset from one cell to another.  For now, the best I can do is a release
note that provides the following admonitory information:
   The fts syncfldb command is used to synchronize the filesets that reside on
   an aggregate with the FLDB of the cell in which they reside.  The command
   creates FLDB entries for filesets that do not have them; it also updates
   FLDB entries to record the current locations of filesets whose entries
   do not accurately record their present sites.  However, the fts syncfldb
   command is inappropriate for creating FLDB entries for existing filesets
   from one cell in the FLDB of another cell, a situation that can occur if
   a disk is physically moved from a server machine in one cell to a server
   machine in another cell.
   For example, suppose fileset Foo has fileset ID number 0,,8 in the FLDB of
   cell A.  If the disk that houses fileset Foo is removed from its server
   machine in cell A and installed on a server machine in cell B, the fts
   syncfldb command should not be used to create an entry for the fileset in
   the FLDB of cell B:  If fileset Bar with ID number 0,,8 already exists in
   cell B, the command updates its FLDB entry to reflect the location and
   information associated with fileset Foo, making it impossible to access
   fileset Bar.  Issuing the command on the aggregate that houses fileset Bar
   corrects the entry for that fileset, but fileset Foo is then no longer
   accessible.  Because of potential fileset ID number conflicts of this type,
   there is no convenient way to move a disk partition from a machine in one
   cell to a machine in a second cell and update the FLDB of the second cell.
This is a first draft of a possible release note.  Please feel free to provide
any corrections or clarifications to this information, as necessary.  I would
like to include information about this problem in the release notes sometime
in the next day or two.  Sorry for any confusion; thanks for any help.

[3/22/93 public]
Jeff - The Release Note looks good - it's a confusing topic. Could you add
a short paragraph about what you SHOULD do when there is a fileset id
number conflict and syncfldb is not appropriate? Ie. how does one change
the cell A fileset id of Foo to add it to cell B? Thanks.
 
Craig - Are we changing this CR to a doc one and adding a separate CR for
the code enhancement request? Or do you feel the manual steps Jeff will
describe above are sufficient to cover this?

[3/22/93 public]
I believe that I understand the suggestion that Gail is making; I even think
that I understand its motivation.  I still feel strongly that syncfldb
isn't a general aggregate-import tool, and that it's weakened by adding
that requirement to it.  I have nothing against the creation of a tool
that would do this aggregate-import function, and am happy to deal with
an enhancement request to that effect.
 
We haven't even discussed all the problems with importing filesets into
a new cell.  For instance, if there are any ACLs at all, even ones that
are created implicitly, in the fileset, you can't naively import such
filesets into a cell, because the UUID of the cell will be different from
the cell UUIDs stored in the ACLs.  Now, it's possible to re-create a cell
with the same UUID as that of the previous cell (which it must therefore
be replacing), in which case the operation makes sense.  But the naive
importing of live filesets will simply fail, for well-understood reasons.
It continues to make sense to detach a disk from one server and attach
it to another server in the same cell, then running syncfldb; it
continues to make sense to use syncfldb to repair some classes of damage
that might be encountered if fileset operations are interrupted at
inopportune moments; and it continues to make sense to use syncfldb to
recreate an FLDB after installing a new cell (with the same UUID as before).
But, by definition, all concurrently-active cells must have different UUIDs,
so it doesn't make sense to import filesets across cell boundaries, since
the UUIDs will no longer match up.  Interestingly, fileset dump and restore
will preserve complete ACLs, with cell UUIDs, so dump and restore can't be
used naively to move fileset contents.  One thing that will work today is
to tar together the contents of the filesets on a disk, move the disk,
clean it completely with ``newaggr'', re-create the filesets with
``fts create'', and restore the non-ACL contents of the filesets via tar.
This isn't ideal, but to do the job right would require the translation
of arbitrary ACLs, which is quite a tough problem.
 
So, in direct answer to Gail's questions, yes, in my opinion, this has
turned into a doc defect report, and there might be a code enhancement
request yet to be created, also.  So far we've resisted the temptation
to make any of the fts commands interactive (going so far as to remove
a question that ``fts restore'' used to ask), in hopes of making this
command suite more useful for script-writing--if you were looking for
any kind of existing command suite style guide.  I'm hoping that I've
clarified some of the difficulties to be faced by an aggregate-import
function, or even a fileset-import function, as motivation for keeping
the syncfldb/import functions distinct (as I thought they were in this
first round of tools).

[3/25/93 public]
Okay, this CR is now a doc one assigned to Jeff at Transarc. Up'd the
priority to 1 to reflect the fact that the Release Note has to be done
in order to ship.
The enhancement request is CR 7594.

[4/10/93 public]
I included the following release note, with some slight modifications, in the
DCE 1.0.2 Release Notes:
*** Begin Release Note ********************************************************
The documentation needs to state that moving a fileset from one cell to another
is not supported with DFS.  Neither of the following fileset operations is
supported:
 o Dumping a fileset in one cell and restoring it in another cell.
 o Moving the physical disk on which a fileset resides from a machine in one
   cell to a machine in another cell.
Moving a fileset from one cell to another causes the following types of
problems:
 1. The ACLs on file and directory objects in the fileset prohibit access to
    the objects because they are essentially "foreign" ACLs in the new cell.
    Because all ACLs contain the UUID of the cell in which they are are
    created, objects that have ACLs cannot be moved between cells.
 2. The fileset's ID number may conflict with the ID number of a fileset in
    the new cell.  A fileset's ID number is unique within the cell in which
    it is created; it may not be unique in another cell because a different
    fileset may already have that ID number in the other cell.
Note that if a physical disk is moved from a machine in one cell to a machine
in a different cell, the fts syncfldb command is inappropriate for creating
FLDB entries for existing filesets on the disk in the FLDB of the new cell. 
The fts syncfldb command synchronizes the filesets that reside on an aggregate
with the FLDB of the cell in which they reside.  It creates FLDB entries for
filesets that do not have them; it also updates FLDB entries to record the
current locations of filesets whose entries do not accurately record their
present sites.
For example, suppose fileset foo has fileset ID number 0,,8 in the FLDB of cell
A.  Suppose also that fileset bar has fileset ID number 0,,8 in the FLDB of
cell B.  If the disk that houses fileset foo is removed from its server machine
in cell A and installed on a server machine in cell B, the fts syncfldb command
should not be used to create an entry for the fileset in the FLDB of cell B:
The command updates the entry for fileset bar to reflect the location and
information associated with fileset foo, making it impossible to access
fileset bar.  Issuing the command on the aggregate that houses fileset bar
corrects the entry for that fileset, but fileset foo is then no longer
accessible.  Such fileset ID conflicts prohibit the moving of a disk partition
from a machine in one cell to a machine in a second cell.
*** End Release Note **********************************************************

Looking through the rpccp man pages I see several example that show what a
user would type from a command line.  The prompt in all cases is `$' which
is usually thought of as being for /bin/sh or /bin/ksh.  In some cases
environment variables need to be set and the csh setenv command is used
(see export, remove element, unexport, and rpccp man pages for examples,
there may be other instances).  

Either change the prompt to `%' the traditional C Shell prompt, or change
the setenv to the /bin/sh method:

    $ set foo=blah
    $ export foo

Note in ksh that the above can be combined to:

    $ export foo=blah

A good base may be to use the POSIX.2 shell version.  I don't KNOW what
this is, but I think it's the same as ksh.

Note also that in some cases (see export.8rpc) the nearby text explictly
says that in the Csh you can use the setenv command.  This should probably
be changed as well.

[03/17/93 public]
Actually the sh,ksh syntax is
	$ foo=blah
	$ export foo

[5/27/93 public]
Assigned to myself.

[06/03/93 public]
Changed to "verified".  Dave Weisman confirmed that the sh/ksh syntax
was the way to go.  I changed the csh examples to the sh/ksh
syntax cited above by rsalz in all affected man8rpc ref pages:

In the rpccp man page there is a footnote in a table.  It gets oddly
formatted in the ascii version, and is easily changed to be a note after
the table.  From the ascii version:

     ____________________________________________________________
     Strings within
     quotation marks

     ____________________________________________________________

     1 Some UNIX systems require that you place an escape symbol
     (\) before string binding delimiters such as brackets ([ ])
     or that you place the delimiters within quotation marks (' '
     or '' '') at the system prompt.

(Go ahead, find the "1" in the table, I dare you! :-)

An example in the Arguments and Options section seems wrong.  From the man
page: 

     Arguments and Options
     Except for the exit and quit commands, rpccp commands have
     one or more options.  Each option is identified by a -
     (dash) followed by a letter; for example, -s. Some options
     require arguments.

     Commands that access NSI operations also require the name of
     a name service entry as an argument.  The order of arguments
     and the entry-name option is arbitrary; for example, the
     following placements of arguments and options are
     equivalent:
     rpccp> add entry  /.:/LandS/anthro/mis_node_2  \
     > ec1eeb60-5943-11c9-a309-08002b102989,1.0

     rpccp> add entry ec1eeb60-5943-11c9-a309-08002b102989,1.0  \
     > /.:/LandS/anthro/mis_node_2

1. The example doesn't describe the text as it has two arguments and no
options.  This doesn't show how options and arguments can be given in any
order. 

2. The add entry command on its man page says it takes only one argument
and an option that specifies a syntax where we only support one right now.
Perhaps this was meant to be add element and the non-name part (the UUID
and version number) are supposed to be an option given with the -i switch.

[06/03/93 public]
Changed to "verified".  Changed the "add entry" command in this
rpccp.8rpc ref page example to the "add element" command, using
the -i option to specify an interface identifier.  This solves
both of the problems listed in this CR.

Reassigned this CR to myself from Julie Buckler. Moving some
of information specified in 4.1, 4.2, 2.1 out of Admin Guide
Volume 1 and into Intro to DCE to decrease redundancy between
books (same text repeated in both books).

[4/5/94 public]

Moved two architectural figures (one for CDS, one for GDS)
and some conceptual text about typed and untyped names
from 2_comp.gpsml and 4_serv.gpsml to /intro/intro/3d_directory.gpsml
(conceptual info about typed, untyped names), /intro/intro/3e_cds.gpsml
(CDS architectural figure), and /intro/intro/3f_gds.gpsml (GDS
architectural figure).

Sections 2.1 and 4.1 are impacted by dcecp and dced. Consequently,
I am resassigning this enhancement CR to Ward Rosenberry (dcecp writer and
Admin Guide - Introduction book owner) so that he can consider it when
revising these sections to include dcecp and dced. I also
reassigned the Severity/Priority of this CR to D4 per Hal Lichtin.

[8/29/94 public]

Setting this CR to verified. First, Chapter 2 and information from sections
4.1 and 4.2 in the admin gd intro was removed since it repeats information
from the Intro to DCE. 

More relevant CRs cover the intro material needed for dced and dcecp in the
Introduction to DCE. They are 10014 for dcecp and 08545 for dced.

Chris Doherty of OSF noted that the explanation of how to register
a DCE cell in DNS could be more complete.  Below are two email
messages with information on this topic:

=========================================================================
From kevins@osf.org:

Subject: DCE: DNS Registration for Intercell
Date: Mon, 08 Jun 92 14:50:45 -0400


This is an outline of DNS registration for intercell communications. 

machineX                        IN      MX      1 machineX.dcetest.osf.org.
                                IN      A       111.222.5.111
machineX_cell.dcetest.osf.org.  IN      MX      1 machineX.dcetest.osf.org.
                                IN      TXT     "1 004D0AEF-D4C6-1A2C-A082-E26DE
0B20080   Master /.../machineX_cell.dcetest.osf.org/machineX_ch 007DE8B2-D4BE-1A
2C-A082-E26DE0B20080 machineX.dcetest.osf.org"

This is what a typical dns authority record looks like. This is what I
would expect as input from would-be registrants. Most of the record is
self explanatory, however some notes are in order. First, notice the
periods at the end of the full host name in the first line and in the
third line. Also note the period at the end of the cell name in the
third line. This is very important. These periods prevent DNS from
automatically forcing a domain name. Please note the machine name,
including domain, at the end of the TXT record (4th line).  This is
not supplied by the cdscp show cell command. I believe one of the keys
to dual DNS registration is the fact that the entry defining the
machine does not contain a domain suffix or a period. The cell name
machineX_cell.dcetest.osf.org is arbitrary. The dcetest.osf.org is not
needed but is added for clarity not brevity.  It is, however, a bad
idea to have the cell name exactly the same as the machine name. (ie
machineX.dcetest.osf.org is a bad cell name)

The other change that needs to be made on the host machine is 

/etc/resolv.conf needs to be changed to:

; /etc/resolv.conf - OSF specific
; use for caching local client
;
domain		dcetest.osf.org
nameserver 111.222.5.111

This specifies that machineX is the primary name resolver for the 
dcetest.osf.org sub-domain.

Subject: DCE: Q&A Defining a Cell in DNS
Date: Thu, 05 Nov 92 17:05:11 -0500


>Got a question on how to deine a cell (where name server is NOT running on the

>Admin Guide Section 11-3 (Page 11-6) gives an example to set up the named data

This doesn't make sense to me.  That '2' is a preference value in case
there is more than one way to deliver mail to that host.  I really can't
see how setting it to two makes a difference.  Tom, do you know if this is
bogus?  Weidong, just use the value '1'.

>What if name server is running on another machine? WHat are the other valid

Once again, I think this is all bogus.

>ANother question related to this: it says that the first record can be of

>MX, then is there a subtype like field for me to specify whether the named is

Here's an example how to use it with MX:

macaroni_cell   IN      MX      1               macaroni.osf.org.
                IN      TXT     "1 007411F2-176A-1A1D-B00A-123456789ABC   Master
 /.../macaroni_cell.osf.org/macaroni_ch 002260D2-1766-1A1D-B00A-123456789ABC mac
aroni.osf.org"

Notice the machine "macaroni.osf.org." is the "Mail Exchanger" for 
macaroni_cell.  Macaroni.osf.org knows how to deliver mail to macaroni_cell.
I know we're not delivering mail but there's something else going on that 
I don't fully understand. 

>Or, as I would imagine, it does not matter whether named and cdsd are runnin
>gon the same host at all.

We always ran a local caching named on the same machine (at least I did).
But, the local named goes and queries its fowarder, or a master server, in
our case.  My guess is it shouldn't matter unless the code for cdsd 
needs to talk directly with named as oppossed to using resolv.conf.

Note that the examples on page 12-6 of the 1.0.3 Admin Guide (core)
are wrong: the name of cell should be either an absolute domain name
(cs.tech.edu. - note the final dot) or it should not include the default
domain (presumably tech.edu in the example, but that depends on details
of the configuration file, so it would be better to use absolute names
in the examples).

Also, I checked the RFC to find out how TXT data should be represented
in the configuration file. As far as I can tell it does not specify it -
however, all the implementations I have tried use double quotes, NOT
parentheses. Also, you can't embed comments in the string.

sec_rgy_acct_get_projlist documents long as the datatype for input
parameters max_number and output params. unix_projlist, supplied_number,
and num_projects.  

The wire protocol actually uses ndr_long_int which is a 32 bit quanity.
Long on the otherhand may or may not be 32 bits.

The inconsistant use of datatypes does not port to machines where a long
is not 32 bits.  This is especially a problem for output parameters.

The include file generated from acct.idl will not be consistant with the
documentation, leaving application writers confused.  Because of this
an acceptable workaround does not appear to exist.

The documentation and interface need to be consistant.

Janet

[3/15/92 public]

et tu brutus.

The wire protocol and the semantics of the operations are well defined.
They are an IDL "long" which is an ndr_long_int which is a 32 bit 
quantity.  The values defined for these operations can only be 32 bits
they can never be anything else.  You might argue that there is a bug
in the IDL compiler in that it generates a .h file that uses the ambiguous
"long" C datatype - but there is no ambiguity in the IDL data type.

In any case - I think it serves us all to change the IDL definitinos
to be "signed32" (aka long) so that it is clearer to the reader.  This will
have no change in the protocol - it is exactly the same thing as long.

[3/17/93 public]
IDL generates the correct .h file.  The type of the arguments is
ndr_long_int.  The inconsistancy is in the documentation.  It says long
and should say ndr_long_int for 1.0.2.  If the idl types are going to change
to signed32, the documentation needs to be updated to signed32 also.
In addition, the AES must specify either ndr_long_int or signed32, but
not long.  

I have talked to Joe Pato and we seem to be in agreement.

After finding a bug in a test I had written based on Walt's timop example,
I went back and checked Walt's code.  Sure enough, he violated the rules
for using the comm status variable the same way that I did, but wrote his
program in such a way that he didn't get caught.  

  Specifically, the timop .idl and .acf files both declare the comm_Status
and fault_status variable.  In this case, according to the ACF doc, the 
manager code in the server must set the comm_status and fault_status 
variable(s) to rpc_s_ok in no error is encountered.  If the manager code
does not handle this, and no error occurs, then the value of the comm or
fault status variable(s) will be whatever they were when the call was 
started.  Walt does not set the comm_status value in the timop manager 
code, but since he make all of his RPC's from a routine that 
initializes the comm_status variable, makes on RPC and returns, he 
doesn't get burned.  I got singed when I tried follwoing his example
in a program that looped making RPC's (and I am not the only one!  
Someone got this error into print as part of a tutorial printed in
a major industry rag!!).

  The REAL right thing to do is to make the comm_status variable 
appear in only the .acf file.  In this case, the RPC runtime will initialize
it to rpc_s_ok,so if the call is okay, you know it.   However, since 
doing the REAL right thing also means adding a duplicate .idl file, and a
bunch of extra crap to the Makefile, building the client and server in
seperate directories, the most feasible thing to do for the short term is
to make the manager code set the comm_status variable to rpc_s_ok.

[03/09/93 public]
Updated  the inter-related defect field to show the doc defect open to 
get the code changed in the doc as well as the tree, perhaps with a
bit of accompanying explainatory text.

[9/23/93 public]
Changed area to doc and re-assigned to Doug Weir as per aggreement with
him.

[11/2/93 public]
This is fixed. I did "the most feasible thing" as described by Mark
above and inserted the assignment in timop_manager.c

[11/12/93 public]

This has been tested on the HP, 486, and AIX platforms. After checking
with Tom Jordahl I'm closing this bug.

There is no man page for the command gdsipcinit in the Adminstration
Reference, Section 2. Global Directory Service. This command is 
referenced in the Release Notes and the Porting and Testing Guide, among
other DCE books.

If the man page is in another book, please let me know.

[3/9/93 public]

I think it is not necessary to have a man page for gdsipcinit,
because it is an internal which a normal user or administrator never
use. It is something what you will use sometimes by porting when the
system is not complete installed and you have to do a lot
of administration by hand. For that the gdsipcinit is described 
in the porting and testing guide.

[3/23/93 public]
I'm afraid we're going to have to disagree about this one, Helmut.
OUr feeling is that any command referenced in the release notes should
have a man page.  Deferred until 1.0.3

In the description of the pthread_keycreate function, the destructor
function parameter is declared to be of type pthread_destructor_t.

I grepped the doc source and could not find a definition of
pthread_destructor_t.

We have two choices: 1) Show definition of that data type, or 2) show the
function as in the Posix P1003.4a/D4 spec:

	int pthread_keycreate (pthread_key_t *key,
		void (*destructor) (void *value));

At the end of Chapter 11 "Building an Application", it says (for binop
example) the server can be terminated at any time by a quit signal, which
on many systems can be generated by Ctrl-C.  At the end of section 11.4.2,
it states that TRY-CATCH_ALL-ENDTRYT block will actually catch the signals.

This is not true.  At least starting from 1.0.1, CMA threads package does
nothing for asynchronized signals (SIGINT, SIGHUP, etc). It is up to the
sigwait to do it. By default, cma does not catch those signals, nor does it
convert them into exceptions to raise.

cdsclerk is an example to show how to catch async signals to do the
clean-up. It spawns a signal_catcher() thread to especially sigwait on
those async signals. Whne it gets one, it calls the clean-up routine.

Note, the current 1.0.2 doc still states the same thing, although I am not
sure whether it is still chapter 11.

[06/08/93 public]
Changed "Fix By Baseline" field from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3.

[07/06/93 public]
Reassigned this CR to writer Steve Lewontin.

[10/12/93 public]

Removed the TRY block from the sample code and removed the related text.
Having a thread do a sigwait() would be the correct approach here, but
this is beyond the scope of this example which mainly illustrates how to
build a DCE application.  This is more appropriate as an enhancement for
the 1.1 threads documentation.  I have written such a sample handler thread
for use in the 1.1 documentation and will file an enhancement OT.

Also removed the text added to deal with OT 8041.  This proposed a
probably non-portable use of signal() to install a signal handler.  Although 
POSIX is still not settled on this issue, it looks like sigwait() is the
correct way to go.

[10/12/93 public]
There's another problem here in that <ctrl-c> generates an interrupt
signal, not a quit signal.

Verified change in latest doc build and closed this CR.

This comment is from Norbert Leser at OSF.  In Figure 7 of the
chapter on Name Service Interface Usage, he requests that the 3
instances of "L&S" be changed to, for example, "LandS".  I think
this is because the & is not a legal name character.  I would
go in and change it myself but it's a postscript file so I can't.

	Error on entity: /.../psycho.cells.sni-usa.com/test/2/2
	Insufficient rights to perform requested operation (dce / cds)
	Function: dnsCreateDir

I expected in the first case, where the cds-server has no access
to the directory, that I would receive the error message:

	Error on entity: /.../psycho.cells.sni-usa.com/test/2/2
        Insufficient rights to perform requested operation (dce / cds)
        Function: dnsCreateDir

as I did on all of the other cases.

In addition, it does not seem to matter *what type* of permission
that the server has to the directory, just that it has some.  This
also seems inconsistent.

[1/18/93 public]

This is the designed behavior.  If the user has some access but not the
right permissions, the "insufficient rights" error is returned. If the
user has no access at all, "entry does not exist" is returned.  This is
supposed to prevent name guessing.  I have changed this to a documentation
bug, because I don't think this distinction has been made there.

[06/08/93 public]
Changed "Fix By Baseline" field from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3.

[07/06/93 public]
Reassigned this CR to Diana Goldfarb.

[10/93 - verified by Alan Peckham]
The information is available in the documentation as follows:

- The manpages for cdscp create dir state "(Note that the server
principal requires \*Lread\*O and insert permission to
the parent directory of the new directory.)"

Changes made as follows:

cds_status_codes.7cds:
 Corrected error message from "Requested name does not exist" to
 "Requested entry does not exist"

 Expanded on the explanation.

6_cds_access.gpsml
 Added the following text to the section "DCE Permissions Supported by
 CDS":

 "A principal needs some permission to a name before it can try to perform
 management operations on the name.  Otherwise, CDS does not recognized
 the name when the principal tries the management operation and returns
 an error that the name does not exist.  If the principal has some
 permissions, but not those required to perform the operation, CDS
 returns an error explaining that the principal had insufficient rights
 to perform the operation."

[12/7/92 public]
Output of the fts lsheader and, by implication, fts lsft commands needs to be
updated to reflect the additional information each will now provide about the
actual, allocated size of a DCE LFS read/write fileset.  Due to the nature of
read/write and backup filesets, each read/write fileset has both a "visible,"
or effective, quota and an "allocated," or actual, quota.  The visible quota
is that which can be changed directly via the fts interface; the allocated
quota is the true disk usage of the read/write fileset.  The output of these
two fts commands will now include an additional "alloc" field to apprise the
administrator of a fileset's allocated quota.
Users will be concerned only with the visible quota, as that dictates the
amount of data they can store in a fileset.  When they deal with users,
administrators also will be concerned with the visible quota.  However, when
they are concerned with the actual, physical disk usage of a read/write
fileset, administrators will need to be aware of the allocated quota.
Because backup filesets are implemented with copy-on-write anodes, it is the
allocated quota of the backup version of a fileset that has the effective disk
usage of the newly-cloned read/write fileset on which it is based.  As data in
the read/write fileset changes, the read/write fileset's allocated quota grows,
while the backup fileset's quota remains unchanged until the next backup
operation.
The administrator who needs to move a fileset to make room on an aggregate
needs to be aware of the allocated quotas of both the read/write and backup
version of the fileset, as the combined allocated quotas of the two types of
filesets represent the amount of disk space that will be freed by the move. 
The combined visible quotas may or may not reflect the true sizes of the two
filesets.
Backup and replication operations will be adjusted to achieve logical, expected
results.  In other words, the fts interface will handle the two types of quotas
in such a way that their implementation is transparent to both the user and the
administrator.  (An additional defect will be created to reflect the necessary
documentation changes of this code change on the DFS API documentation.)

thanks.

Unfortunately I won't list everything here, but looking through the man
pages in the admin ref, the format of the synopses are inconsistent.  Some
give a full path to a command, some give no path, and some give /usr/bin
which is a softlink.  Some examples (hopefully the man page will be
obvious)

dceshared/bin/passwd_export
dceshared/bin/passwd_import
dceshared/bin/rgy_edit
secd
dtsd
/usr/bin/dtscp
gdad
cdsd
cdscp
rpccp

In addition, the man pages for the individual commands within the control
programs usually just list the command in the synopsis.  For the rpccp
commands however the synopsis lists "rpccp <command>".  (I really wish I
could show italics in bug reports! :-)

[5/27/93 public]
Assigned to myself.

Fixed.  Solution verified by Howard Melman.

Added "dtscp" control program name to SYNOPSIS

from appropriate man5sec reference pages (2).

The use of short forms of server machine names is discouraged in DFS.  This
information has appeared only as a release note; it needs to be documented
in appropriate places in the Admin Guide and Admin Ref documents.  The text
of the original release note on this topic follows:
"Do not use the short form of a machine name (for example, do not use <foo>
instead of /.../<cellname>/hosts/<foo> or /.:/hosts/<foo>) when issuing DFS
commands.  The results of using a short form name are unpredictable."

The following release note changes the documentation that needs to be provided
for this defect:
 
   The documentation currently states that a server machine to be used with
   a command must be specified by its full DCE pathname (for example,
   /.../abc.com/hosts/<hostname>).  However, DFS commands that require a
   machine name also accept the short form of the machine's name (for example,
   <hostname>.abc.com or just <hostname>) of the machine's IP address (for
   example, 11.22.33.44).  Commands in the bos suite are exceptions to the
   use of short form names and IP addresses; if you use either of these
   methods to indicate a server machine with a bos command, the bos program
   displays the following message and executes with the same privilege as if
   you included the -noauth option:
 
      bos: WARNING: short form for server used; no authentication
      information will be sent to the bosserver
This information needs to be included across the documentation.

        Suggestion - The notes section in the introduction to DTS might
        be more appropriate before the interface routines descriptions.

[07/06/93 public]
Reassigned this CR to myself.

[07/08/93 public]
Moved the information in the NOTES section 
(containing important definitions) before the alpha listing of 
DTS routines.  This information had been buried at the end of 
the ref page and could easily have been missed by a reader.

[08/19/93 public]
Closed bug.

Section 2.5

Change section:

	"Hardware support for secure booting would involve a way of
knowing

	* The name of the diskless machine
	* the name of each boot server
	* the diskless machines's Kerberos private key

To:

	"Hardware support for secure booting would provide a way of
knowing

	* The principal name of the diskless machine
	* The principal name of each boot server
	* The authentication key for the diskless machine's principal


The word "principle" is used incorrectly in place of "principal" on 
the following pages:

	3-3 	(standard type block, variable name and comment)
	3-4	Variable name table

Throughout Chapter 4 machine names are used fairly loosely.  I assume
that these names are IP hostnames - but nothing in the text indicates
this.  I could reasonably assume that these names are the CDS name
for the host or the principal name for the host.  This should be
more clearly specified.  An example is from section 4.4.2.1 
	
	dsw_adm addfile -server s -file f

	where s is the name of the swap server host...

[6/11/92 public]
defer to 1.0.2

[11/20/92 public]
defer to 1.0.3

[5/4/93 public]
reopening for 1.0.3

[10/27/93 public]
Fixed all bugs identified by Joe Pato in the Admin. Gd -- Extended
Services. Joe's chapter numbering was incorrect, but all the fixes
he reported were necessary.
