	This bug terminates the test suite made for the DFAM Client,
and serverity will be C1.  The real problem of this bug is that 48 files
must be changed (the actual fixing required to each file is one or two
lines), and a vendor may find it cumbersome to change the bug manually.
	The PM team agreed to supply the new DAT files in the /project/archive
portion of the GA tape.  Release note will explain the problem and tell the
users how to copy the new DAT files to replace the old DAT files.

There isn't any information available to indicate which testcase failed.
Nothing in the journal (in fact, the journal filter reports that the
threads_up testcase passed.)

I've since rerun the xds testcases and the problem did not reoccur.

Happens on HP only,  sometimes tests report FAIL when it looks like they
should have succeeded.  Sometimes they hang (Does not look like they are
in the daemon).  All dced opersations conitnue to work.

[9/21/94 public]
srvrexec test Failures are due to a typo in my TET tetexec.cfg file, they
have now been running in loop for 10 minutes.

srvrconf test still hanging after first test completes successfully, will
remove TET calls and see if that helps.

While running the dcecp keytab functional tests, my root partition 
filled up (several times, so I think several tests are doing this).

The following files were found in /tmp:

-rw-------   1 root     system              122 Sep 19 17:23 ktb1.ktb
-rw-------   1 root     system          22298624 Sep 19 17:24 ktb2.ktb

This is blocking full runs of functional tests.

[9/20/94 public]
Ran keytab FVT's successfully on 486.  No exceptionally large files in
/tmp, all tests pass (except a few negatives due to SAMS changes).

John, what platform are you running this on?  I will try on my HP once
I configure it with NB.

Note that the files in /tmp are keytab files.  Unless the tests are somehow
going into an infinite loop of adding keys (I don;t see this as possible) I
can't think of how they might produce such large keytab files.

Are the tests returning?  What are the results?  PASS/FAIL?

[9/20/94 public]
Running on the 486.

The root partition is failing, so everyhting on the machine starts to
fail. The tests fail because they run out of space.

[9/21/94 public]
This is most likely a dup of SEC OT 12036.  Will wait for re-run of tests
on latest build to makr dup.

[9/26/94 public]
Tests are running succesfully so it's a dup.  Thanks.

The sample ACL manager in the svr_example directory wil not be shipped
with 1.1.  Apparently this code is needed by some security functional tests.
If so, then the code should be moved over to the appropriate directory
and taken out of the mainline source tree.

[7/15/94 public]
Yup, this is test code only and never should have been in the core tree in
the first place (it was put there many years ago before a test tree even
existed).  Bruce has offered to do this already for us, so I've reassigned
this to him and he can dup it if he already has a CR open for it.

[7/15/94 public]

Yes, Mike Burati and I agreed I would move 
src/security/client/admin/acl_edit/svr_example to
src/test/security/acl_edit/svr_example
And Yes, CR 11379 is already open on it.

The test named above hangs "forever" without notification of anything
going wrong.  From running the same command that the test is performing
manually, I have reason to believe that auditcp might be dumping core
(See ot 11010), which is causing the test to hang.  I would expect the
test to fail and continue, not hang.

The admin tests write the output of the test to a file 'test_trace.'
Because it is not prefixed, it is written in 

	/opt/dcelocal/var/adm/directory/gds/adm

The TET scripts, however, invoke check_ERROR() (of lib/shfuncs) to parse
this file for error messages.  The check_ERROR() function, however, expects
to find the test_trace file in 

	$OUTPUT/test_trace

During a test run with OUTDIR defined, nothing was written in this
directory.  

This prefix must be removed from check_ERROR() or the test cases must be
changed to specify OUTDIR on the invocation of cacheadm.

test/file/rep/rtest3 contains two for loops with
the following line
        xxx=`fts lsheader $SERVER_1 $EPI_AGGRNAME_1 | grep $base_name.2 |
grep On-line`
 
the fact that the grep is on the next line cause an grep useage
message and the loop to run until tries meets the loopcount
maximum
 
although it does not cause any test failure it does cause the
runtime of the test to be longer than necessary
 
either a 'line continuation' should be placed where the grep On-line
is or better yet place it at the end of the previous line as do the
other tests (rtest1 rtest2)

File "Testcases" is at the top of the list of files in the Makefiles
for "src/test/directory/xds/tests.xoms/threads_af,threads_as but it
doesn't exist in these directories.

By the way, there's another directory below src/test/directory/xds
called "tests.xom".

fts/test21 creates a 1MB file on /tmp and never deletes it.  Multiple runs
will use up /tmp.  Also, it doesn't explicitly check if /tmp is full. I can
only guess what sort of failure mode this would lead to.

I inadvertently fixed this as part of the fix for OT CR 9633, so am dup'ing
it as appropriate.
If the bug is not fixed, eventually /tmp fills up and on the next run of fts
test21, it creates a filler file of length zero.  Then, when it tries to
fill up the aggregate by repeatedly cp'ing the filler file into it, its rate
of progress is so slow as to appear to be zero.

The mechanism used in test21 of fts test suite does not set the quota size of
a fileset (to be moved) and the size of remaining space  of the target
aggregate correctly. As a result, the size of the fileset in question could
be still smaller than the space left in the aggregate and the move would
succeed which defeats the test purpose. This could happen if the source 
aggregate is much smaller than the target aggregate. 
Furthermore, when the particular scenario fails, the test did not stop. The
subsequent two test scenarios that depend on the result of the first one also
fail.

during long runs (48 CHO) on the hp. Let me know if you have questions
or problems fixing this Steve - thanks!

If this is a duplicate bug, you should re-open the old bug.
Do not open more than one OT for the same problem.

In fact, if you *had* gone to reopen the old bug, you would have
discovered that it was, in fact, not closed (or marked 'fix').

I have submitted a fix for this problem today, so tonights build
should not have this problem.

Bug canceled.

The variable random was changed to variable r in order to allow the use
of the random() function for obtaining random numbers.  Unfortunatly, this 
change was not made in two sleep calls.  In these calls, the address of the
random function was apparently interpreted as the number of seconds to
sleep. This value (~11987432), however, proved to be too long for most
test purposes. 

The fix is to use the variable r in the sleep calls.

This defect is fixed in a version of filewnr.c that is shipped on the 
DCE 1.0.2a Release tape as:

   src/unintegrated/test/systest/file/filewnr.c

See the README accompanying the release tape for details on what to 
do with this fix.

[9/23/93 public]
The fix for this defect was wrapped up in the port of filewnr.c to the HP,
so I am dup'ing this to defect 8578, which is for that port.

In general, these tests clearly haven't been ported to HP/UX.  Some of the
instances are identified below, but there are too many to make individual
reporting worthwhile.

If these compilation errors cannot be resolved in a timely basis then these
tests should be removed from the nightly build by modifying the
test/systest/Makefile SUBDIRS line.

You are right. They are not ported to HP-UX because they weren't included
in the list of tests which need to be ported.

[7/22/93 public]

These two are actually part of the 6 new system tests which are being
ported by our systest group and will be given to OSF when they are done.

This problem was found during the verification of the DCE 1.0.2 release tape.

The functional test ./src/test/directory/cds does not build if one
does not have the object tree from the DCE build. Without the object 
tree the following error produced while compiling the test:

   1501-106: (S) Include file cds_types.h not found. 
"/home/DCE1.0.2/verify/dce/V1.0/dce/export/rios/usr/include/dce/cds_clerkserver.h",
line 216.1: 1506-046 (S) Syntax error

The problem was caused by the Makefile in the test/directory/cds directory 
depending on VPATH to find the idl-generated header file cds_types.h (which,
incidentally, is exported to the usr/include/dce directory, but which is 
included in a header file as <cds_types.h>; ie: no 'dce', prefix which
would have caused the file to be found in the export area) in the cds/stubs
area of the object tree. 

Long-term, this dependency of the cds funtional tests on another non-test 
object tree directory should be removed. The only thing that should be
needed to build the tests is the stuff in the export tree, and possibly the
obj/test tree.

[8/20/93 public]
The VPATH used in Makefile is used to find source files and in this case 
it is used to find cds_clerkserver.idl and cds_types.idl. The problem here
is the similar as OT#6773 which uses the non-exported internal herad files.
So marked this bug as dup of OT#6773.

The api sec_acl test, which is executed from
src/test/security/api/control/sec_acl.tsh, is incorrect for test case
number 6. The current file contains the following:

> test $TEST \
> "10 sec_acl_replace" \
> $SEC_ACL_REPLACE $error_status_ok \
> root -dce- $SEC_ACL_TEST_OBJ
  ^^^^
When "cell_admin" is substituted for "root" this test passes.

Marked 'dup' of 2893, since this is part of that problem.  Your fix
looks correct.  Go ahead and submit it if it fixed the problem for
you and the DRB lets you.  Also changed from 'code' to 'test' software.

[5/1/92 public]
I don't believe that the fix outlined above is the correct fix.
Please see my note in bug number 2893 (of which this is a dup).
If you still think that the fix should be made, please update 2893.

The following changes need to be made to the DTS System Tests (dcetmchg,
dcetmudt, dcetmsyn, dcetmbkc, dcetmmin):

- Add the use of su.dce so the processes have the proper authorization to
  perform the tasks they are attempting.

- Debug on a recent level of DTS.
