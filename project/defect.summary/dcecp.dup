One of our developers reports that the man page for clearinghouse has the
wrong names for the counters.

%man clearinghouse 
.
.
.
COUNTERS
     The clearinghouse counters are:
 
     badchs    Specifies the number of  times  the  clearinghouse
               entry missing event was generated.
 
     baddata   Specifies the number of times that the data  corr-
               uption event was generated.
 
     badskulks Specifies the number of times that a  skulk  of  a
               directory,   initiated  from  this  clearinghouse,
               failed to complete- usually  because  one  of  the
               replicas in the replica set was unreachable.
 
     badupgrades
               Specifies  the  number  of  times  that   upgrades
               failed.
 
     disables  Specifies the number of times that  the  clearing-
               house was disabled since it was last started.
 
     enables   Specifies the number of times that  the  clearing-
               house was enabled since it was last started.
 
     partials  Specifies the number of requests directed to  this
               clearinghouse  that  resulted  in  the return of a
               partial answer instead of satisfying the  client's
               request.
 
     reads     Specifies the number of read  operations  directed
               to this clearinghouse.
 
 
     writes    Specifies the number of write operations  directed
               to this clearinghouse.


In reality:

        badchs -> missingentries
        baddata -> corruptions
        badskulks -> skulkfailures
        badupgrades -> failedupgrades
        partials -> returnedrefs
        rootlosts -> rootunreachables

OT 13323 was closed with the note:
"All 'time' related attributes are no longer specified as 'hours',
but rather 'relative_time', talking about DTS relative time format,
including the syntax.  As of 1.2, there is no confusion with these
attributes."
But in looking at the source file for the registry manpage, the syntax
description of the maxtktlife attribute still describes it as taking
"hours" as a parameter rather than "relative_time."  The description
prose describes maxtktlife as using relative time, so I'm sure this
was just an oversight in editing, but the syntax should be made to
match the prose descrition to avoid confusion.
Added field Transarc Deltas with value `15667' 
Added field Transarc Status with value `open'

[4/2/96 public]
Sigh.  This is the code from dcecp_registry.8dce, dropped to OSF on
10/95...

.LI "\*Lmaxtktlife \*Vrelative_time\*O"
This registrywide account policy defines the maximum amount of time
that a ticket can be valid.
Specify the time using the DTS relative time format (\*V[-]DD-hh:mm:ss\*O).
When a client requests a ticket to
a server, the lifetime granted to the ticket takes into registry the
\*Lmaxtktlife\*O set for both the server and the client.  In other
words, the lifetime cannot exceed the shorter of the server's or
client's \*Lmaxtktlife\*O.  If you do not specify a \*Lmaxtktlife\*O
for a registry, the \*Lmaxtktlife\*O defined as registry authorization
policy is used.

I don't know why the file in the OSF tree does not reflect this, but
it IS done.  HP will do a second manpage drop soon, and I've double-checked
to make sure this is STILL in our version of the manpage.  In the mean
time, I'm considering this a dup of 13377.

[4/2/96 public]
Jim is correct. I am the guilty party who did the work, and I
just checked my copy of the file as received, which reads just
as given above. It came in correct, and I sent it out incorrect.
Either I missed the parameter name change or (more likely) in-
correctly understood the issue.

"clearinghouse show" can take an option of "-attribute", indicating that
clearinghouse attributes should be returned.

clearinghouse help show shows this option. But the Command Ref for this
subcommand does not mention this option.

It is also important to point out that this option does not return any
specific attribute. To do so, the user can use "attrlist" command.

[3/25/96 public]

The clearinghouse manpage (command_ref) is fine, but there are a
number of bad examples of 'clearinghouse show -attribute' in the
admin guide.  Please fix these.

[3/26/96 public]

This is a duplicate of ot13326, which points out the same 'clearinghouse
show' command examples.  I added the text from this ot into 13226 so that
the points about stressing what the '-attribute' option does and the use
of 'attrlist' will not be lost.

Following is a list of various defects found in the utc.8dce
manpage by Maria Wadlow at Transarc and communicated to us here
at OSF. These defects are in the course of being fixed at this
moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially
register the changes...

        In the "cell backup" command description, steps 1 and 3 each
        contain a dcecp example that is too long to fit on one line.
        In dcecp commands, if you type a \ (backslash) at the end of a
        line, dcecp will continue the command on the next line with a
        ">" prompt.  In step 1, the ">" appears in the middle of the
        second line of the command and in step 3 it doesn't appear at
        all.  These examples should be fixed such that if a user types
        exactly what appears in the examples (including the
        backslash), the right thing will happen.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

                    Specifies the organization for the local account
                    that is being created.

          -facct foreign_account_name
                    Specifies the name for the administrator in the

                    accounts.

                    permission to create accounts in the foreign cell.

          -expdate account_expiration_date
                    Optionally sets an expiration date for both local

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

	"An object represents a CDS object.  An object in the DCE
	Directory Service has a CDS name and associated attributes

	This isn't very clear and the first sentence is a little

	associated with it."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0231		form	ComRef	1-179	man8dce/object.8dce

	The sentence is missing its . (period).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0233		tech	ComRef	1-182	man8dce/object.8dce

	The "object modify" example says that it is describing how to
	change an attribute value, but the example uses the "-add"
	option instead.

        A - (dash) is separated from the option name by a newline in
        the output.  In troff, this can be prevented by inserting a \
        (backslash) before the - (dash), which prevents the word from
        being broken over a newline.

	"If you specify a wildcard object entry name, you also need

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

        In the "cell backup" command description, steps 1 and 3 each
        contain a dcecp example that is too long to fit on one line.
        In dcecp commands, if you type a \ (backslash) at the end of a
        line, dcecp will continue the command on the next line with a
        ">" prompt.  In step 1, the ">" appears in the middle of the
        second line of the command and in step 3 it doesn't appear at
        all.  These examples should be fixed such that if a user types
        exactly what appears in the examples (including the
        backslash), the right thing will happen.

	"If you specify a wildcard object entry name, you also need

        This is apparently leftover from cdscp, but is not applicable

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

Following is a list of various defects found in the host.8dce
manpage by Maria Wadlow at Transarc and communicated to us here
at OSF. These defects are in the course of being fixed at this
moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially
register the changes...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0193		typo	ComRef	1-150	man8dce/host.8dce

	"The behaviour of commands..."
	"behavior" is misspelled ("-ior" is the Style Guide spelling).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0194		tech	ComRef	1-150	man8dce/host.8dce

	"...qualified names (as in /.../hosts/hostname/)..."
	This should be "/.../<cellname>/hosts/hostname/" instead.
	Also, this name and the cell relative name are displayed in
	italics, when they really should be bold.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0195		tform	ComRef	1-150	man8dce/host.8dce

	The "OPERATIONS" section reference is bold in all but one
	instance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0196		tech	ComRef	1-150	man8dce/host.8dce

	"You must have  permission to the /.:/hosts directory in CDS."
	First, no permissions are listed in this sentence as it
	appears.  Second, no special permissions are required to
	perform the "host catalog" command.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0197		form	ComRef	1-151	man8dce/host.8dce

	The output of the "host catalog -simplename" command is in the
	wrong font; it should be in courier.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0198		form	ComRef	1-151	man8dce/host.8dce

	The "-cell" option of the "host configure" command should be
	in bold.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0199		typo	ComRef	1-151	man8dce/host.8dce

	The "-cds" option of the "host configure" command has two
	dashes, "--cds," instead of one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0200		typo	ComRef	1-152	man8dce/host.8dce

	"...start, stop, show,and unconfigure..."
	A space is missing between "show," and "and."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0201		typo	ComRef	1-153	man8dce/host.8dce

	"whether DCE processes are accesible from..."
	"accessible" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0202		typo	ComRef	1-153	man8dce/host.8dce

	"No special privleges are required..."
	"privileges" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0203		form	ComRef	1-153	man8dce/host.8dce

	"This command The syntax is:"
	The string,  "This command ", should be removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0204		tech	ComRef	1-153	man8dce/host.8dce

	There is no description for the "host stop" command, it starts
	off immediately with the syntax.  Something like, "Stops all
	DCE processes on the specified host.", would suffice.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0205		typo	ComRef	1-154	man8dce/host.8dce

	"Deletes all principal names begining with..."
	"beginning" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0089            form    ComRef  
				1-152	man8dce/host.8dce

        In the "cell backup" command description, steps 1 and 3 each
        contain a dcecp example that is too long to fit on one line.
        In dcecp commands, if you type a \ (backslash) at the end of a
        line, dcecp will continue the command on the next line with a
        ">" prompt.  In step 1, the ">" appears in the middle of the
        second line of the command and in step 3 it doesn't appear at
        all.  These examples should be fixed such that if a user types
        exactly what appears in the examples (including the
        backslash), the right thing will happen.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0128            style   ComRef  1-91    man8dce/dcecp.8dce
					and elsewhere

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:

	The "gid" attribute is described as having a "value" argument
	when, in fact, the argument is an "integer"; "integer" is the
	term used elsewhere for this type of argument.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0184		typo	ComRef	1-142	man8dce/group.8dce

	"The value for this option is either yes or no.  If it is
	no..."
	The values "yes" and "no" should be displayed in bold, but are
	instead displayed in courier.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0186		gramm	ComRef	1-143	man8dce/group.8dce

	"...groups to be have members added to."
	This would be better worded as, "...groups to which members
	will be added."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0187		form	ComRef	1-143	man8dce/group.8dce

	The "group catalog" example should display the user-typed
	command in bold as is consistent with other examples.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0188		form	ComRef	1-144	man8dce/group.8dce	(x2)

	The values "yes" and "no" in the description of the "-alias"
	option should be displayed in bold to be consistent.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0189		tech	ComRef	1-145	man8dce/group.8dce

	"...an operation (catalog, create, delete modify or show)..."
	The "list," "remove," and "rename" commands are missing from
	this list.  Also, some of the commas are missing from the
	list.  Finally, the "or" appears in bold by mistake.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0190		tech	ComRef	1-146	man8dce/group.8dce

	"You can specify attributes to be removed..."
	"removed" should be "added", this description is for the
	"-add" option of the "group modify" command.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0191		typo	ComRef	1-148	man8dce/group.8dce
				1-149	man8dce/group.8dce

	"You must have rf permission to the specified groups..."
	There should only be a single period, not three.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	"Attributes are returned in the following order: fullname,
	gid, uuid, alias and inprojlist."

	fullname."

        A - (dash) is separated from the option name by a newline in
        the output.  In troff, this can be prevented by inserting a \
        (backslash) before the - (dash), which prevents the word from
        being broken over a newline.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0030            typo    ComRef

        The actual output of the help command doesn't match

        The permissions required depend on what you are modifying.
                "ra" to change auth information
                "rm" to change management information
                "ru" to change user information
                "ru" + "r" on the Registry to change password

	The argument to the "-binding" option is listed as a
	"protocol_sequence_list."  This argument is more accurately
	called a "string_binding_list," since the command expects a
	string binding and the examples give a string binding.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0176		tech	ComRef	1-132	man8dce/endpoint.8dce

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

	The last paragraph in the description of the "directory

	The initial description is very sparse and the reader
	won't know what the command really does until they read
	the last paragraph, so it might be better to provide
	that information earlier.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0158		tech	ComRef	1-120	man8dce/directory.8dce

	"You must have administer, write, insert, or delete
	permission to the directory."

        A - (dash) is separated from the option name by a newline in
        the output.  In troff, this can be prevented by inserting a \
        (backslash) before the - (dash), which prevents the word from
        being broken over a newline.

        Suddenly the style has shifted to "write permission."  The

        The square braces in the syntax line vary between being bold

        In the Synopsis and command descriptions, the commands are
        usually listed in alphabetic order.  Therefore, the "clock
        compare" command should appear before "clock help," not after

        The "-epoch" option takes an "epoch_number" argument.  Also,
        the "-abruptly" option and the "-epoch" option should be

        The examples of the string binding and the dcecp string syntax

        the braces.

Following is a list of various defects found in the cell.8dce
manpage by Maria Wadlow at Transarc and communicated to us here
at OSF. These defects are in the course of being fixed at this
moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially
register the changes...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0085            style   ComRef  1-59    man8dce/cell.8dce

        "If omitted, `/.:' is the default."
        The use of single quotes here does not follow the style of the
        rest of the book.  Elsewhere, the single quotes would be
        omitted and the name would be bold.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0086            typo    ComRef  1-59    man8dce/cell.8dce

        "Each value is the name of a dts server in the cell.
        "DTS" should be uppercase.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0087            tech    ComRef  1-59    man8dce/cell.8dce

        The string, "OSF DCE Administration Guide" was a hardwired
        reference and should have been a macro.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0088            typo    ComRef  1-59    man8dce/cell.8dce

        "...and the type pringstring."
        "printstring" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0089            form    ComRef  1-60    man8dce/cell.8dce       (x2)

        In the "cell backup" command description, steps 1 and 3 each
        contain a dcecp example that is too long to fit on one line.
        In dcecp commands, if you type a \ (backslash) at the end of a
        line, dcecp will continue the command on the next line with a
        ">" prompt.  In step 1, the ">" appears in the middle of the
        second line of the command and in step 3 it doesn't appear at
        all.  These examples should be fixed such that if a user types
        exactly what appears in the examples (including the
        backslash), the right thing will happen.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0090            typo    ComRef  1-60    man8dce/cell.8dce

        "(Refer to the cell object reference page for the required
        privileges.)"
        This is the cell page.  It probably shouldn't have an internal
        reference to itself.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0091            tech    ComRef  1-60    man8dce/cell.8dce

        "It also requires the user to be authenticated to the dce
        security service as the cell administrator."
        There is no requirement that a cell have a cell administrator
        account.  This might be better worded, "It also requires that
        the administrator possess the privileges typically associated
        with the cell_admin account."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0092            tech    ComRef  1-60    man8dce/cell.8dce
                                1-61    man8dce/cell.8dce

        "You must have r permission to several directories in the CDS
        namespace."
        The directories should be listed here:
        /.:/hosts
        /.:/hosts/<machine>
        /.:/subsys/dce/sec/master

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0128            style   ComRef  1-91    man8dce/dcecp.8dce
					and elsewhere

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

        "server_name_list"
        According to a developer who looked at the code, this is
        command can not actually handle a list, but can only handle a
        single name.  The description of the server_name_list argument
        should also be modified from "This is a list of one or more
        simple names for..." ("of" was misspelled) to "This is a
        simple name for..."  The description of the "cdscache delete"
        command should also be modified from "...argument is a list of
        one or more simple names given..." to "...argument is a simple
        name given..."  The description the "cdscache show" command
        should be similarly modified.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0076            tech    ComRef  1-55    man8dce/cdscache.8dce

        "cdscache help [-verbose]"
        This should be "cdscache help [operation | -verbose]"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0077            tech    ComRef  1-55    man8dce/cdscache.8dce   (x2)

        "It is not a cell-relative name like /.:/hosts/pelican/self)."
        The name should be "/.:/hosts/pelican" and the extraneous
        right parenthesis should be removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0078            tech    ComRef  1-55    man8dce/cdscache.8dce

        "There are two choices of protocol sequence, depending on the
        network address that is supplied in the binding: ncacn_ip_tcp
        or ncadg_ip_udp"
        This depends on the implementation.  It would be more accurate
        to say, "Protocol sequences have a specific format that
        depends on the network address that is supplied in the
        binding, for example, ncacn_ip_tcp (for a connection-based
        protocol) or ncadg_ip_udp (for a datagram protocol)."

                                1-57    man8dce/cdscache.8dce

        "For the network-address, specify an Internet address using
        the common Internet address notation."
        This shouldn't be so Internet-centric.  It would be more
        accurate to say, "The network-address is a string representing
        the network address of the server node."  Later, the phrase,
        "Internet address" would be better phrased, "network address."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0080            tech    ComRef  1-55    man8dce/cdscache.8dce

        "...to give a clerk addressing information about a server
        across a WAN."
        This is misleading, this is often needed in non-WAN
        environments as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        "...permission to the clerk system."
        This would be more helpful if the name of the clerk system was
        given, such as, "You must have w permission to the clerk
        system, /.../<cell>/hosts/<machines>/cds-clerk."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0082            typo    ComRef  1-56    man8dce/cdscache.8dce

        "command" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0083            form    ComRef  1-56    man8dce/cdscache.8dce

        "Use this command when solving CDS problems."
        This sentence is meaningless and should be removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0084            form    ComRef  1-58    man8dce/cdscache.8dce

        The font is wrong in the output of the second example of the
        "cdscache show" command.  It should be courier.  The font is
        also wrong in the "clearinghouse catalog" command example and
        in the "clearinghouse show" command example.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

Following is a list of various defects found in the acl.8dce
manpage by Maria Wadlow at Transarc and communicated to us here
at OSF. These defects are in the course of being fixed at this
moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially
register the changes...

        "...which may exist on any object such as a server,
        interface, name service entry,..."
        This list should not include "interface."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0035            form    ComRef  1-20    man8dce/acl.8dce

        "See the Data Structures section..."
        The section name is italic and capitalized.  It should be bold
        and uppercase to match other similar references that appear
        elsewhere in the document.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0036            tech    ComRef  1-21    man8dce/acl.8dce

        "/.:/sec/principals/friendly.company.com"
        The registry object is really called "principal" with no "s"
        at the end.  This error is made four times in this section.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0037            typo    ComRef  1-21    man8dce/acl.8dce

        "Acl Entry Syntax"
        Despite being a section name, "ACL" should be uppercase.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0038            typo    ComRef  1-22    man8dce/acl.8dce

        "Defined Acl Entry Types"
        Despite being a section name, "ACL" should be uppercase.

                        effective user."

        "other_obj      Permissions for others..."
        This entry only applies to authenticated others in the cell.

        "foreign_group  Permissions for a specific, authenticated
                        group..."
        The phrase, "authenticated group," makes no sense.

        "ACL's" is possessive when it should be plural (ACLs).

        "You must have r permission."
        The required permissions are defined by each ACL manager.

        "acl" should be uppercase.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0048            typo    ComRef  1-26    man8dce/acl.8dce

        "...such as files in Episode filesystems."
        "Episode" should now be referred to as "LFS."  According to
        developers, this line is mis-advice anyway.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0051            tech    ComRef  1-26    man8dce/acl.8dce

        "acl delete {/.:/sec/principal /.:/hosts}"
        Should choose a more innocuous example, something that won't
        hurt the system if the user tries it verbatim.  Also, the
        preceding paragraph implies that this command will yield a
        syntax error.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The option "[-type manager_type_name]" was omitted from the
        "acl permissions" command prototype line.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0054            tech    ComRef  1-30    man8dce/acl.8dce

        "dcecp> acl replace..."
        The rest of the example is elided.  An example might be:
        "acl replace /.:/foo -acl {user fred rwc}"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0055            tech    ComRef  1-31    man8dce/acl.8dce

        The command prototype line appears twice.

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}

                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

The dcecp specification (RFC42.3) list of changes (Section 1.1) lists the
following item which is not contained in the OSF DCE Command Reference:

       (dl) The `acl show' command describes the causes of UUID's being
            displayed instead of names more completely.

[1/19/96 public]

As far as I could determine, there was no new material associated
with this item in the November drop of dcecp manpages from HP. I
am reassigning responsibility to Pam Millett, who is about to do
some further work on the manpages.

The dcecp specification (RFC42.3) list of changes (Section 1.1) lists the
following item which is not contained in the OSF DCE Command Reference:

       (cs) Modified description of `clock set' so that `-to' is optional.

[1/19/96 public]

In the text of the clock.8dce manpage included in the November
drop from HP, the (changed) text plainly states that the -to option
is required (as if to say, the original assertion of this CR is in-
correct). I'm leaving this bug open and reassigning it to Pam Millett,
who is about to do some further work on the manpages at HP.

[2/2/96 public]

The -to option is not required.  The usage of the command is

   clock set [dts_entity]
      {-to DTS_timestamp [-abruptly -epoch epoch_number] [-bypass] |
       -epoch epoch_number}

[2/28/96 public]

The conclusion from the above seems to be that this bug should
be cancelled. But I'm afraid to do that. So I'm "deferring" it
to 1.2.2 instead, and Pam can cancel it if she decides that's
the thing to do.

[2/29/96 public]

Doug, you were correct in leaving this bug open.  The usage of
the command is correct (as above), showing that when you use
'clock set' you can just change the epoch of a dts_entity by
using -epoch (without -to).

But in the body of the manpage, down in the 'clock set' part,
there is a sentence that begins "The required -to option...",
clearly stating -to is required.

When I put the usage comment on 2/2 I should also have stated that
it verified your comments of 1/19 and the body of the manpage was
incorrect.

We've fixed this in the manpage review Pam is applying now, so
it will go away soon.

[1/19/96 public]

Well, I wasn't quite sure what to do here. There was some new material
for this passage in the November dcecp manpage drop from HP, which I
incorporated into the dts.8dce manpage (and marked the spot with .zA/
.zZ and the CR number); but the new material states the default as
being "0-00:15:00.000", whatever that means-- apparently not 5 minutes
(the previous value was "0-00:10:00.000"). ...By the way, as far as I
can see, the manpage nowhere states in what time-unit(s) the numerous
numeric values are expressed in-- which seems a defect to me.

So I have left this bug open, even though there is a change labelled with
its CR number in dts.8dce, and have reassigned it to Pam Millette, who is
about to do some further work on the manpages. She can both check what I've
already done and make whatever additions seem to be necessary.

It was noted that when issuing the "dcecp -c group list" command that
it can only handle 1024 members in the list.  I have found that the code
is hardcoding the max_members and the output list to be 1024.
This causes problems for users that have more than 1024 members in a 
group.  The memory should be dynamically allocated to handle as many
members as neccessary.

[7/21/95 public]
Check OT12822.  It describes the same problem, and
includes a fix (which works well).

"dcecp -c cdscache create" occasionally needs to be executed more than once
before it works.  Since this doesn't happen with "cdscp define cached server"
and the errors suggest some kind of uninitialized variable or command arg
parsing problem, reported against dcecp -- but maybe it's just pilot error,
or something already fixed...  A particularly bad case requiring six attempts:

When trying to set acls on DFS objects I get:

dcecp> acl mod /:/ -add {any_other rx}
Error: Invalid ACL entry.

but if I use traditional string syntax it works:

dcecp> acl mod /:/ -add any_other:rx         
dcecp> acl show /:/
{mask_obj rwx-id}
{user_obj rwxcid}

Am I doing something wrong?  or is this a defect?

[10/7/94 public]
Looks like a dup of the last CR to be fixed in the 1.1 tree.  Try it with
the latest bits and see, glad to reopen if necessary.

tests in isolation or the the whole "directory" set of tests. I have
never seen "clearinghouse create" fail in this manner. I don't know if
this situation is being created by preceding tests (the clearinghouse
tests come after the directory tests) or if there's a configuration
difference, or what.

[9/27/94 public]

I note that all the clearinghouse positive tests failed in the same
way. I've changed the short description and assigned this to Kevin.

This is a cds problem.

I mistakenly typed 'cat' instead of 'show' to look at an ERA.  Seems
like I should get an error, instead got strange output with names of other
existing ERAS added to my attr:

The reason is simple that sec uses only one attr schema object now
and ignores to check because it'll make no difference on server side. 
This is the same treatment used by dced server and Jim at HP opened 
an OT against dced schema server (OT#12324) too. 
In this case, dcecp does "right" thing not to check the attr schema object
name because schema server is the one who knows name.

[9/26/94 public]
The "bug" if it is that is on the dced server side and is represented by CR
12324 as ping said.  I'm still trying to figure out if it's in fact a bug.
See that CR for details.

The dcecp smoketest fails on the RIOS and AT486.  I'm creating a new
OT because the dcecp build problem's fixed (OT 12312) so I'll cancel
my update to 12312 about the smoketest.

(The HPUX core smoketest hasn't finished yet due to possible network
delays.)

[9/23/94 public]

Fixed incorrect OT# reference.

[9/23/94 public]
Dup of 12319.

While running the dcecp keytab functional tests, my root partition 
filled up (several times, so I think several tests are doing this).

The following files were found in /tmp:

-rw-------   1 root     system              122 Sep 19 17:23 ktb1.ktb
-rw-------   1 root     system          22298624 Sep 19 17:24 ktb2.ktb

This is blocking full runs of functional tests.

[9/20/94 public]
Ran keytab FVT's successfully on 486.  No exceptionally large files in
/tmp, all tests pass (except a few negatives due to SAMS changes).

John, what platform are you running this on?  I will try on my HP once
I configure it with NB.

Note that the files in /tmp are keytab files.  Unless the tests are somehow
going into an infinite loop of adding keys (I don;t see this as possible) I
can't think of how they might produce such large keytab files.

Are the tests returning?  What are the results?  PASS/FAIL?

[9/20/94 public]
Running on the 486.

The root partition is failing, so everyhting on the machine starts to
fail. The tests fail because they run out of space.

[9/21/94 public]
This is most likely a dup of SEC OT 12036.  Will wait for re-run of tests
on latest build to makr dup.

[9/26/94 public]
Tests are running succesfully so it's a dup.  Thanks.

Since I installed the build of 9/6/94 (contains fix to CR 12027),
attempts to run any of the "server" commands (cat, show, start)
frequently return an error of "Communications failure". The same
command repeated a few seconds or minutes later will sometimes
succeed, but once it starts doing this the failures outnumber the
successes. For instance, the "host start" script I'm working on does
the following:

  server cat

[each server in returned list]

  server show
  server start

Sometimes the "cat" fails, sometimes the "show", and sometimes the
"start".

During testing of the 'xattrschema create' command for generic
schema attributes, I can only create one generic schema attribute.
All subsequent create commands give an error.

   dcecp> xattrschema catalog /.:/hosts/oddball/config/xattrschema -simplename
   hostdata/filecontents
   hostdata/bincontents
   xattrschema/dtsconfig

   dcecp> xattrschema create /.:/hosts/oddball/config/xattrschema/test_blech_2 -encoding integer -aclmgr {group r r r r}
   Error: Cannot create object; already exists

[8/31/94 public]

I was in the middle of opening another bug with the description "create of generic schema
should provide uuid if one is not specified" when it dawned that possible this is the
problem here.

   dcecp> xattrschema show /.:/hosts/oddball/config/xattrschema/test_blech_1
   {aclmgr {group {{query r} {update r} {test r} {delete r}}}}
   {annotation {}}

   {trigtype none}
   {unique no}
   {uuid 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}

But if you create a new attribute in the security schema, using the same create line as
above, a uuid is assigned to you if you do not specify one.  The generic schema create
should work the same way.  So if you cannot afford a uuid, the generic schema should
appoint one for you.

[8/31/94 public]
Actually it has nothing to do with generic schema i/f. It's due to the dced 
schema server implementation problem. This is a dup of CR11840.

[9/1/94 public]
Funny, I thought I'd heard this problem was reported, but when I scanned
thru the bugs for dcecp, I couldn't find it.  No wonder!  Sorry, Ping.

Either way, please note that when a schema entry is created in the generic
schema it should be assigned a uuid if one is not specified.  Thanks.

[9/1/94 public]
The reason that generic schema i/f doesn't check and create uuid for
a schema entry to be created is to keep consistent with sec_rgy_schema i/f
implementation, besides other than uuid there are a number of fields in
schema entry need server side to check so it is make much more sense to
leave the valiadation work to the server side. It's also what sec schema
server implementation does.

Dcecp file dcecp.out contains the following

RPC

PGO

This means it either died in PGO and didn't start the ACL test

[8/15/94 public]
Yeah, it fails in the PGO tests.  This is a dup of 11698. 

To get around this in the smoketest comment out the following line:

This is a dup of 11631.  When ODE encounters an error it reports it at the
time it occurs.  It ALSO reports at the end of the pass that the entire
pass did not complete succesfully.  dcecp happens to be at the end of the
pass so it looks like errors in dcecp, but it's not.

I found that the performance of using simplenames or
fullnames is very different, in fact, using full names
results in errors sometimes.  Below are some commands run on
a build of 6/24/94 that output the members of each group in
the rgy.  When using fullnames I get an error of Registry
Server Unavailable.  When using simplenames, it works.

[6/28/94 public]

I think this should be punted to sec, Rajendra. Here is what I have 
found out. The entry that is failing is:
/.../absolut_cell/subsys/dce/sec-admin

If you remember when the dcecp code is passed a fullname as an argument
the that code is then passed to sec_rgy_site_bind_{query,update}().
Those procedures should open the master/{arbitrary replica}, depending 
on the call, if the name passed in is not a valid rgy_site name. 
This works after R. Stanzel made the fixes a few weeks ago. 

However, sec_rgy_site_bind_{query,update}() ALWAYS fails to correctly 
ascertain that a path begining with:
/{cell_name}/subsys/dce/sec 
is not a valid rgy site name. 

For instance:

/.../absolut_cell/subsys/dce/sec

will work however,

/.../absolut_cell/subsys/dce/sec{insert anything here}

will not work. 

You can take try this out on "name parse" which currently does two
things. 
A.) attempts to open a site within the cell of the name passed
    in. (may soon change. see related CR)
B.) calls sec_id_parse_name 

Try:

name parse /.:/subsys/dce/se
name parse /.:/subsys/dce/sec
name parse /.:/subsys/dce/sec-

The first two will pass and the third will fail always.

[kevins 07/01/94 public] 

I passed this off to security. It seems there is a pattern of 
path name failures. names that begin with /.:/subsys/dce/sec
will always fail. Also names that begin with /.:/hosts will
also fail.

Nightly build of 6/20:

dcecp> secval activate

Causes a core dump of dcecp.  Other dced operations seem to be working.

[6/21/94 public]

Try "secval activate hosts/your-host-name", if it doesn't core dump, 
please mark it as dup of CR10948.

[6/21/94 public]

This form of the 'secval' command does not work, no core dump, it does not
recognize the host name:

  dcecp> secval activate hosts/oscar
  Error: Unrecognized hostname 'hosts/oscar'.
  dcecp> secval activate oscar
  Error: Unrecognized hostname 'oscar'.

Won't mark as dupe just yet.

[6/21/94 public]
Yes, the reason is the checking of return of dced_binding_create() didn't
cover the NULL hostname case and if hostname is not NULL and the 
dced_binding_create() fails it assume the hostname is incorrect. This has
been fixed and I'll check it in soon. The OT is a duplicate of CR10948,
as well as last half of Prasad's CR11027.

If a user types "help" at a dcecp> prompt, something useful should happen.
Perhaps something directing the user to the other help systems or the "man
dcecp" command.

Use automated FVT tests to verify:

This is OK:
dcecp> acl rep /.:/jas1 -ic -acl {{unauthenticated r} {group subsys/dce/cds-admin rwdtcia}}
dcecp> acl rep /.:/jas1 -io -acl {{unauthenticated r} {group subsys/dce/cds-admin rwdtc--}}

Removed free((char *) replace_acl_entries); in dcp_acl_do_replace_entries().

rpccp should provide some option to call rpc_ns_set_authn (false, ..., ...);
to allow testing of unauthenticated cds access.

(I had to code up a patched version of rpccp which allowed this for the
show profile command in order to help debug an inter-cell access problem).

[07/20/93 public]
Bill S. though he could take a stab at this and points out that in
an integrated environment, it might be difficult to get unauthenticated.

[7/23/94 public]
A year later....  This gets punted over to dcecp.

[8/9/94 public]
Marked as dup of 11442 which is somewhat more general for all bindings in
dcecp.
