acl_edit, auditcp, cdscp, dtscp, gdscp, rgy_edit, and rpccp are 
listed throughout admin_gd although they have been replaced by
dcecp. Therefore, adding a NOTE to the Admin Gd Intro about 
dcecp replacing these old/unsupported programs/utilities.

[7/15/96 public]

Note that 'gdscp' isn't replaced by dcecp, and auditcp doesn't
exist (it doesn't have to, dcecp does the audit admin work).

This CR is being opened to track two errors found in server.8dce.
The following correspondence between me and Jim Truitt (my questions
come first, and are followed by Jim's responses) describe the prob-
lems...


> 1. In the server.8dce manpage, there is a complaint
>    about the representation of the output of the
>    server catalog operation. The original Transarc
>    item says that the output of the command should
>    be:
> 
>         /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver not
>         /.:/hosts/foster/config/try_tserver
> 
>    But currently the manpage has the following:
> 
>         dcecp> server catalog /.:/hosts/foster
>         /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvconf/try_tserver 
>         dcecp> 
> 
>    (I.e., only the single line of output.) So who is right?

Here the manpage is incorrect.  The fix was to change

      /.:/hosts/foster/config/try_tserver  (which is an incorrect name)

to

      /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver  (the correct name)

But the fix got messed up, and instead of 'srvrconf', it currently
says 'srvconf'.

So the fix here is to change

      /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvconf/try_tserver

to

      /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver

> 2. There is a Transarc item saying that the "server create" example
>    in server.8dce should not have in its output the "{flags {}}"
>    line, and that the "-starton" line should have braces in it, i.e.

> 
>    , not
> 
>         -starton boot auto explicit failure
> 
>    as in the manpage right now. Who is right?

The manpage is still wrong.  The 'starton' value should have
braces around it for sure.

              [The complaint is about the name of the argument, i.e.

[6/21/96 public]

   Right.  There are actually a few things in the ATTRIBUTES section
   that are wrong...

      "alias value" should be "alias {yes | no}"

      "gid value" should be "gid integer"

      "inprojlist value" should be "inprojlist {yes | no}"

   In the 'description' part of 'cell backup', just before the 'Privileges

	The "-default" option description says, "When you use the
	-default option, all of the other options except -member are
	ignored." but the "-member" option says, "If you use the
	-default option, this option is ignored."  One of these
	statements can not be correct.

                 [The following statement is made under "rpcprofile
                  add": "If you specify the -default option, the only
                  other option that can be supplied is -member." And
                  the statement "When you use the -default option, all
                  of the other options except -member are illegal" is
                  repeated in several places. And the second statement,
                  "If you use the -default option, this option [i.e.
                  -member] is ignored" still appears. So this change
                  hasn't been made.]

	"The version is optional..."
	The version appears not to be optional.

               [The complaint seems to be in regard to the description
                of the keytab create operation. But in fact the "version"
                parameter is nowhere mentioned at all (either as optional
                or as required) in any of the synopses for "create" that
                I can see. The change called for here has not been made;
                but aside from that, there seems to be an additional
                defect, namely the absence of "version" from the "create"
                synopses. Note that "version" is mentioned in the descrip-
                tions, so it seems clear that it should be in the synopses.]

	The example that uses the dcecp string syntax lists the
	"-interface" arguement incorrectly.  There should be a space
	between the UUID and the version, not a comma, in the string
	syntax.

              [I'm not sure about this one. The reference is to the
               DATA STRUCTURES section of the manpage. Two ways of
               specifying an interface ID are given, and this complaint
               is about the first form. The UUID and version are separated
               by a space in dcecp string syntax, but here we are not
               talking about dcecp syntax, but rather about the old
               rpccp-acceptable form (e.g., see rpccp_add_mapping.8rpc,
               where this form is given). Now, whether this form is
               also acceptable to dcecp I don't know; by giving both
               forms here, the authors of the manpage seem to
               think it is: The dcecp string syntax is explicitly
               given (in the right form, I assume) just below the pas-
               sage under question here. So, to sum up, although I think
               this complaint may be in error, I'm opening the bug to
               be on the safe side.]

The current synopsis for this command is:

   clock set [dts_entity]
      {-to DTS_timestamp [-abruptly -epoch epoch_number] [-bypass] |
       -epoch epoch_number}

When '-to' is used, the '-abruptly' and '-epoch' options must be used
together, or not at all:

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show]
      dcecp>

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show] -abruptly -epoch 0
      dcecp>

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show] -abruptly
      Error: '-epoch' option not specified.
      dcecp>

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show] -epoch 1
      Error: '-abruptly' option not specified.
      dcecp>

So the '-abruptly' and '-epoch' options should not be separated.

However, the syntax above implies that '-bypass' can be used standalone,
or in combination with '-abruptly' and '-epoch' (when '-to' is specified).
This is NOT the case:

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show] -bypass
      dcecp>

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show] -bypass -abrutply -epoch 1
      Error: When using '-bypass', other options are not allowed.
      dcecp>

As you can see, it can be used alone, but not in combination.  This
makes the synopsis incorrect as described, but not for the reasons
listed below.  Change this line of the synopsis from:

      {-to DTS_timestamp [-abruptly -epoch epoch_number] [-bypass] |

to

      {-to DTS_timestamp [-abruptly -epoch epoch_number | -bypass] |

which means you can use '-to' alone, or you can use '-to' with
the '-abruptly/-epoch' combination, or you '-to' with '-bypass'.
But '-bypass' cannot be used with the other options.

This change should be applied to both places in the dcecp_clock manpage.

[6/19/96 public]
Status changed to cancel. According to developers here, the 
current syntax for the -abruptly and -epoch options is correct 
as it stands.

The following comes from the original comments to CR 13241, which
was duped to 13377 (marked "fix"). The particular defect described
below seems still to be present. The original description comes
from Maria Wadlow at Transarc; it is followed by my own (bracketed
and indented) comments, made after 13241 was duped to 13377.

        The "-epoch" option takes an "epoch_number" argument.  Also,
        the "-abruptly" option and the "-epoch" option should be
        listed separately, as "[-abruptly] [-epoch epoch_number]"

              [The "epoch_number" argument has been added. However,
               the "-abruptly" and "-epoch" options have not been
               bracketed separately.]

In the section called proc Lets You Create New Commands, the example
of allowing you to specify a default value for an argument using a
nested list structure in the argument list is incorrect.  The text
says that the example will have the second argument default to 1 if no
argument is supplied.  The example:
	proc _attr_show {attr {value "unset"}} {
		puts "$attr is $value"
	}
would default to "unset" not 1.  It should be:
	proc _attr_show {attr {value 1}} {

Our tcl expert balked at the following sentences in the section called
Grouping Elements and Controlling Interpretation:
	Similarly, dcecp uses double quotes and braces to group
	elements into structures called lists.  Lists are a special
	way to group elements so that dcecp can correctly parse
	commands and other data like return values.
A more precise description might be worded as follows:
	Similarly, dcecp uses double quotes and braces to group
	elements into structures.  Double quotes allow elements that
	would usually be parsed separately to be grouped and treated
	as a single element.  Braces are used to group elements into a
	list so that dcecp can correctly parse commands and other data
	like return values.

First, all examples of the history command in dcecp should be listing
"history" as the most recent command.

Second, in the section called Editing Command Lines With the history
Command, the following example is incorrect:
	dcecp>  history
		1 directory show /.:/printers
		2 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer1
		3 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer2
		4 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer3
		5 directory show /.:/printers
	dcecp>  hi s -2 printer3 printer4
	object add /.:/printers/ascii_printer4
The example should be as follows:
	dcecp>  history
		1 directory show /.:/printers
		2 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer1
		3 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer2
		4 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer3
		5 directory show /.:/printers
		6 history
	dcecp>  hi s printer3 printer4 -3
	object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer4
The history command should show up as #6 in the history output, the
event number should be changed from -2 to -3 to account for the
history command in the output, the event number belongs at the end of
the command, and the command being re-executed is an "object create"
command, not an "object add" command.

The section called Editing the Current Command Line should include
some discussion of the behavior of key bindings with dcecp.  For
example, after the lists of control characters and escape sequences,
the following text could be included:

	In some cases, existing terminal key bindings will take
	precedence over these dcecp control keys.  In particular, the
	bindings used for erase, kill, eof, intr, quit, and susp in
	your environment will supercede any dcecp bindings for those
	same control keys.
	In most instances, control keys will not be interpreted by the
	terminal but will be passed through to dcecp.  There are a few
	exceptions though, most notably lnext, or "literal next,"
	which quotes the next character typed.  When you type the
	control key that is bound to lnext it is interpreted by the
	terminal, which will pass the next character typed through to
	dcecp.

This CR is being created (after the event) to record various
changes that were made in the dcecp manpages to reflect additions
that were made in the HP 1.1 version, but which had to be retro-
actively incorporated into OSF's 1.2 baseline. I will update
this report with a short list of the changes that were made.

This CR is for HP's editorial and technical changes to the 
dcecp manpages.

[2/28/96 public]
changed fix by from 1.2 for 1.2.2

[3/1/96 public]
Updating responsible engineer and trying to run 'ot'
using the '-s' option.  So if you didn't get email
about this change, it worked.  :-)

[4/2/96 public]
HP made its first drop of manpages in October '95.  These were
for the 1.2 code base.  In February '95 we took a drop of these
manpages back from OSF, expecting the same as we sent, but found
that not only were some format changes made (which were good),
but some of the technical changes we made were un-done, for whatever
reason.

We've just completed a second thorough review of the manpages, and
will drop them to OSF soon.  We've re-fixed all of what was un-done
the last time, and expect that this time, nothing in them will change
without the approval or review of the component owner or his minions.

The new OT just opened, 13423, is a good example.  The manpage that
was dropped to OSF is correct, but the one in the 1.2 tree Maria
is looking at does not have at least one of the changes.  I'm marking
that OT as a dup of this one, and putting Maria's concerns here.

So, before this OT is marked 'fix', make sure the 'maxtktlife'
parameter is STILL described correctly in dcecp_registry.8dce,
as 'relative time', as it was in the 10/95 manpage drop.

[6/4/96 pubilc]

The example to display the contents of a clearinghouse on page 17-3 of
the Admin Guide-Core is incorrect.  The document shows:

dcecp> clearinghouse show /.:/<name>_CH CDS_CHDirectories -clear
However, the clearinghouse ref page does not list a "-clear" option
for the show subcommand and CDS_CHDirectories is not a valid argument.
The developer reproduces the behavior:
dcecp> clearinghouse show /.:/mough_ch CDS_CHDirectories -clear
Error: Unrecognized argument 'CDS_CHDirectories'.
dcecp> clearinghouse show /.:/mough_ch {CDS_CHDirectories} -clear
Error: Unrecognized argument 'CDS_CHDirectories'.

In ot13404 (which is being closed as a duplicate), wwang points out
these same 'clearinghouse show' example errors, and also asks that the
Admin Guide better stress that '-attribute' does not allow the returning
of a single attribute, and to do that you should use the 'attrlist'
command in conjunction with the 'clearinghouse show' command.

"cell ping" man page says:

"If called with no option it pings the master security server, each CDS
server that has a master clearinghouse, and ..."

What is a master clearinghouse? I would say that a master clearinghouse is
the one that contains any master directories, not just the root directory.

The code uses "directory show $CELLNAME" and checks the CDS_Replicas entry 
for the Replica_Type. If it is Master, it thinks the clearinghouse is the 
master clearinghouse. If it is not, it thinks the clearinghouse is NOT a
master clearinghouse. But this only checks the root directory. The 
clearinghouse that has the readonly root dorectory can have a master dir
/.:/XYZ in it.

So either the code should check every directory, or it should abandon this
concept. Personally, I would abandon it, since there is no master cds
server, there shouldn't be a concept of master clearinghouse.

[2/7/96 public]

There is confusion with regard to what a 'master' clearinghouse is,
and rightly so.  In the security world, the difference between 'master'
and 'replica' is well defined.  In the CDS world, any clearinghouse can
be a master to some directories, read-only to others, thus confusing
the distinction.

In dcecp, the confusion is supported in some places when the concept
of a 'replica clearinghouse' is discussed.  What it really means is
a 'replicated directory' in a clearinghouse.  Look at the internals
of how 'directory show' uses '-replica' and '-clearinghouse' and you
get an idea of where the confusion can come from.

What 'cell ping' (with no options, and disregarding DTS for now) is
trying to do is ping what it thinks to be the master security server
(found using some 'registry' operations) and what it thinks is the
clearinghouse that holds the write-copy of /.: (or whatever cellname
is being operated on).  There is only one clearinghouse that has this
distinction, and in 'directory show /.:' shows up as:

    {{CH_UUID 27320196-5a61-11cf-aa43-0800097da8e0}
     {CH_Name /.../mgm_test_config/bagomon_ch}
     {Replica_Type Master}
     {Tower {ncadg_ip_udp 15.22.51.68}}
     {Tower {ncacn_ip_tcp 15.22.51.68}}}}

In the 'cell' manpage, this is what it means by the "Master" clearinghouse.

You can use the '-replica' option to ping the rest of the clearinghouses in
the cell, as well as the rest of the security replicas.

This is a doc bug.  There is no problem pinging just the master security
server and the clearinghouse that contains the master copy of the cell
directory.  We should have the 'cell' manpage better define what it
is pinging when no options are specified.

[2/7/96 public]
Jim looks to be correct her.  The history is that cell ping would do
what you want it to do.  Is my cell running?  What does this mean?
Can I do anything I would want to in normal operations.  Can I
read/write everything.  So that translates to, are the masters of
everything available.  That would be the master secd and any CDS
server that had a master replica.  But (as the footnote in rfc 42.3
says) it's too hard to find this info out from cds.   There are
options to ping all servers (-replica) and all machines (-clients)

The oringinal compromise (for CDS) was that with no options it would
ping the each cds server but that is very similar to the behavior of
the command with -replica.  Another compromise would be to ping the
server with the master replica of the root directory.  Seems
reasonable, but not quite semantically correct (is this info really
useful to someone vs always wanting to use -replica).  Changes to the
root directory should be very rare.

[2/7/96 public]

I was thinking whether a doc change will do. For the same reason that Howard
mentioned above, I thought it is not that useful and casuses confusion.
I thought we might as well just ping all cds server and leave "-replicas"
for security servers only.

Even we decide to make it a doc bug and change the doc, I would suggest not
to use the word "master clearinghouse". Just say what it does (ping the cds
server that hosts the master root replica).

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}
 
       It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

Following is a list of various defects found in the user.8dce
manpage by Maria Wadlow at Transarc and communicated to us here
at OSF. These defects are in the course of being fixed at this
moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially
register the changes...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0317		typo	ComRef	1-258	man8dce/user.8dce

	"...may not be specifed as these would..."
	"specified" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0045            style   ComRef  
				1-254	man8dce/user.8dce

        "ACL's" is possessive when it should be plural (ACLs).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0098            style   ComRef  
				1-259	man8dce/user.8dce	(x3)

        Suddenly the style has shifted to "write permission."  The
        previously-seen styles were: "c permission" and "control
        (c) permission."  These should be corrected to keep the style
        consistent throughout the document.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0246		style	ComRef	
				1-258	man8dce/user.8dce

	"Returns only the ERA's..."
        "ERAs" should be plural, not possessive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0128            style   ComRef  1-91    man8dce/dcecp.8dce
					and elsewhere

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

[2/9/96 public]
Status changed to fix. 
Fixed by a combination of HP fixes and rcb edits. Only one typo 
remained.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0290		tech	ComRef	1-234	man8dce/rpcprofile.8dce

	The "-default" option description says, "When you use the
	-default option, all of the other options except -member are
	ignored." but the "-member" option says, "If you use the
	-default option, this option is ignored."  One of these
	statements can not be correct.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0291		tech	ComRef	1-235	man8dce/rpcprofile.8dce

	The "rpcprofile delete" example uses the "rpcprofile remove"
	command.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0292		tech	ComRef	1-236	man8dce/rpcprofile.8dce

	"...an operation (create, delete, modify, or show)..."
	The "add," "import," "list," and "remove" commands are missing
	from this list and the "modify" command should be removed.
	Also, the "or" is in bold and shouldn't be.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0293		form	ComRef	1-238	man8dce/rpcprofile.8dce

	"...argument.  The value of the -member..."
	All of this is in bold when, really, only "-member" should be.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0294		typo	ComRef	1-239	man8dce/rpcprofile.8dce

	"...an annotation uby enclosing..."
	"by" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0295		tech	ComRef	1-240	man8dce/rpcprofile.8dce

	"rpcprofile show /.:/users/wards_profile\"
	The \ (backslash) is not appropriate here since the entire
	command fit on on line in this example.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0296		form	ComRef	1-240	man8dce/rpcprofile.8dce

	The output lines in the "rpcprofile show" examples are too
	long to fit on the page.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0025            form    ComRef  
				1-237	man8dce/rpcprofile.8dce
				1-239	man8dce/rpcprofile.8dce

        A - (dash) is separated from the option name by a newline in
        the output.  In troff, this can be prevented by inserting a \
        (backslash) before the - (dash), which prevents the word from
        being broken over a newline.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0030            typo    ComRef  
				1-236	man8dce/rpcprofile.8dce

        The actual output of the help command doesn't match
        what is listed in the reference page.

	Suddenly, in addition to other inconsistencies, the
	permissions are no longer in bold.

Most of these were fixed by HP fixes and rcb edits, but bad DTE 
coding on on example remained.

The manpage for 'cellalias' was included in the November dcecp
manpage drop from HP.

The dcecp specification (RFC42.3) list of changes (Section 1.1) lists the
following item which is not contained in the OSF DCE Command Reference:

       (di) `clearinghouse checkpoint' is now `clearinghouse initiate'.

[8/30/95 public]

  I'm also adding the item (dj) from the spec list since it's closely
  related:

       (dj) Cleaned up the new `clearinghouse' commands, particularly
            `verify'.

[1/19/96 public]

This was fixed in the November dcecp manpage drop from HP. The
clearinghouse.8dce manpage source is marked with .zA/.zZ and the
CR number at the changed places.

       (cu) Changed the format of ERA's of encoding type `void'.

[1/19/96 public]

As far as I could tell, this was not fixed in the November dcecp
manpage drop from HP. I am reassigning responsibility to Pam
Millett, who is about to do some further work on various manpages
for 1.2.1.

[1/19/96 public]

The meager description of encoding type void in the current manpages
pretty much matches the rest of the encoding type descriptions
The changes to the 'void' encoding type were at a lower level than
then manpage is describing.

Of course, we could argue that the manpage should cover all encoding
types in more detail, but that is for another OT.

Actually, this "fix" appears already to have been made in the source

       (e) The description of `link create' has been improved and an
            example added.  The `-linkto' option is no longer required,
            though the value of the `CDS_LinkTarget' attribute is.  Also
            the format of the `CDS_LinkTimeout' attribute has been
            specified, both as an attribute list, and as a short format for
            the `-timeout' option.

      (Also, the "-linkto" option is listed in the doc as "-to".)

[1/19/96 public]

As far as I could tell, there was no fix for this in the November
dcecp manpage drop from HP. I am reassigning responsibility to
Pam Millett, who is about to do some further work on the manpages
at HP.

[1/19/96 public]

The -linkto / -to stuff was resolved (it's '-to').  The manpage has
pretty good descriptions of the CDS_LinkTarget and CDS_LinkTimeout
attributes.  There is also a good 'create' example.

Charlie Rusman at Hitachi noted that several rpc subcommands
(e.g. rpcentry) are documented as supporting the -version
option, but there is no functionality in the API.  

John Rousseau summarized as follows:

rpc* export does not (and should not) take a -version
option. 

rpcentry unexport does take a -version option, and handles
it correctly. 

It seems that rpc* import is the only routine that is in
error. 

The CR's should state that rpc{entry,group,profile}
import should not take a -version option. The documentation
should reflect this change.

[2/2/96 public]

This is the doc part of ot12911, which was fixed in 1.2.1.
The dcecp manpages were updated to reflect the removal of
the -version option.

Firstly, the server(8dce) man page, in the ATTRIBUTES section under "services",
says 

            bindings protocol_sequence_list
                      A list of string bindings identifying the service.
                      This is only specified for well-known endpoints.

However, the restriction that it is only specified for well-known endpoints
is not enforced.  Examples in the "server create" subpage list bindings without
endpoints, and there is no way I know of for dced to check the IDL definition
of an interface for well-known endpoints.  I think that the sentence
"This is only specified for well-known endpoints." should be removed.

Secondly, under the subpage "server stop" of the server(8dce) man page, the
reader should be warned that if there is more than one instance of a server
using a given interface, object UUID and a given binding without endpoints, then
the "rpc" method of stopping the server will stop a randomly-selected instance
of the server -- NOT NECESSARILY THE INSTANCE SPECIFIED IN THE COMMAND.  This is
due to the inability of the RPC runtime to distinguish server instances on any
criteria other than interface and object or endpoint, and the fact that the RPC
specification allows multiple server instances to share the same interface and
object UUID.  This problem does not exist with the other methods of stopping a
server, which will stop only the instance specified in the command.  If the
"rpc" method must be used, then this problem can be avoided by starting only one
server instance for any server config object, and assigning a unique object UUID
for each server config object.

[2/2/96 public]

   This information was included in the 'server stop' section of
   the server man page and is in the November drop.

Here's what's left to do to complete the DCE1.1 dcecp reference pages.

WHAT'S GOT TO BE DONE:
**********************
All of the objects are generally done (in the tree) but many have:
- new or deleted options
- new or deleted attributes 
- changed limitations on options or arguments (number of, required vs
  optional, etc)
The current list of changes is included later (they're all spec'ed in
RFC42.3)


WHAT MIGHT NOT GET DONE:
************************
The 'Permissions Required' sections are uneven. Although most have the
information they need, it's presented inconsistently. That is, some
say "You must have d permission..." others say "You must have delete
permission..." and still others say "You must have (d)elete
permission...". Maybe this is a prentice hall edit.

Unfortunately, there may not be time to provide examples beyond those
already included in the 'EXAMPLES' sections of the ref pages. Further,
those that are already included need to be verified. 

Lots of the text in the reference pages is in passive voice. There is
not enough time in the schedule to convert this to active voice. 


THE LIST OF DCECP OBJECT REF PAGE CHANGES:
******************************************
The following list of dcecp changes was taken from section 1.1 of:

   457385 Sep  8 13:17 /users/melman/dsh/doc/rfc42.3.txt

Generally these items identify changes that must be incorporated into
the dcecp object reference pages.   My comments are flush left. 
**************************


       (bm) Added `registry verify'.

       (bn) Added `-randompwd' option to `account modify'.

See item (dc) which removes the `-ramdompwd' option.

       (bo) Removed ERA's from the `registry' object.

       (bp) Changed `-c' option to `dcecp' to take one value instead of the
            rest of the arguments.  This is so adding more options to
            `dcecp' will not force them to be position dependent.

       (bq) Added the `-certify' option to `login'.

       (br) Specified the order of the output of `registry show'.

       (bs) Specified `-noupdate' on the appropriate RPC commands

       (bt) Changed the default value of the `courierrole' attribute from
            `noncourier' to `backup'.

       (bu) Secified the `user', `host', and `cell' task scripts.

Although these reference pages have bben created, there are questions
about what's implemented for host configure and host unconfigure
operations.

       (bv) Specified the `-s' option to the `dcecp' program.

       (bw) Added the global variable `dcecp_verbose_errors' which causes
            `dcecp' to output the entire contents of `errorInfo' to
            `stderr' in the event of an error.

Possibly mentioned in the dcecp reference page.

       (bx) Renamed the `schema' object `xattrschema' to match the name of
            the namespace objects and the ACL manager.

Done.

       (by) Added the following commands:

Done ->           dts catalog
                  clock compare
                  clearinghouse catalog 
See item (di) and (dj)

       (bz) Added `name get'.

       (ca) Added the `scope' attribute to `xattrschema'.

       (cb) Corrected argument handling of `registry catalog'.

       (cc) Renamed `cellalias' to `cdsalias'.
Done.
       (cd) Changed `cdsalias set -child' to `cdsalias connect'.

       (ce) Specified the output of `cdscache show'.

       (cf) Added `cellalias' object for big hierachical cells script.
Done.

       (cg) Addded the following commands:

                  clearinghouse checkpoint
                  clearinghouse repair
                  clearinghouse verify

       (ch) Added that the `applydefs', `intercell', `scope', and `unique'
            attributes on the `xattrschema' object are only advisory in DCE
            1.1.

       (ci) Changed the default value of the `tolerance' attribute of the
            `dts' object to 5 minutes as per DCE CR 11089.

       (cj) The `user' commands take a list of user names as an argument.

       (ck) Fixed typo in `object show -schema' description.

       (cl) Added that the user must be `root' to run `cdscache dump'.

       (cm) Clarified the descriptions of the `goodsince' and `server'
            attributes of the `account' object.

       (cn) Changed the description of the `CDS_ObjectUUID' attribute in
            the `directory' and `clearinghouse' objects.

       (co) Clarified descriptions of all the attributes of the `directory'
            object, particularly the `CDS_INCHName', `CDS_UpgradeTo', and
            `CDS_RingPointer' attributes.

       (cp) Updated output of CDS commands.  The `cdscache show' command
            output has been changed, also the following attributes of
            `directory' and `clearinghouse show' commands have changed:

                  Clearinghouse_uuid     CH_UUID
                  Clearinghouse_name     CH_Name
                  dir_uuid               Dir_UUID
                  directory              Dir_Name

       (cq) Added `-local' to all `keytab' commands.

       (cr) Typo in `masteruuid' attribute of `registry', the value is of
            type UUID, not integer.

       (cs) Modified description of `clock set' so that `-to' is optional.

       (ct) The `rpcgroup add' command now allows the user to enter
            duplicates entries and does _not_ flag an error.

       (cu) Changed the format of ERA's of encoding type `void'.

       (cv) Added the `registry connect' command.

       (cw) There is a new optional argument `registry catalog' to specify
            a single name of a cell or a string binding.

       (cx) Specified the syntax of multiple routing and debug routing
            specifiers.

       (cy) Added the `_h' convenience variable.

Add descriptions of the convenience variables _b, _c, _h, and _u to
the dcecp reference page. (see item dd)

       (cz) Added the `registry set' command.

       (da) Specified that `import' only reports an error if no match was
            found in _any_ of the names specified in the argument list.

I believe 'import' applies to rpcentry, rpcgroup, and rpcprofile objects.

       (db) Renamed `name' in the `service' attribute to be `entryname'.

Not sure what refpage this is in...

       (dc) Removed the `-randompwd' option from the `account modify'
            command and added the `account generate' command.  This is to
            avoid the case where a password can be changed in the registry
            but the server crashes before the user is informed of the new
            password.

       (dd) Added the `_b(sec)' convenience variable to replace portions of
            `_s(sec)'.  This way `_s' is only set by the user not by
            `dcecp', and `_b' is only set by `dcecp' and not by the user.
            Much less confusion can reign.

       (de) Added the `operations' attribute to the `server' object.  It is
            only available for input, it is not output.

       (df) Specified that the argument to `registry show -master' can be a
            cellname.

       (dg) Added the `-noprivacy' option to all `keytab' commands.

       (dh) Added a new section on _Warning Messages_.

This information goes in the dcecp reference page.

       (di) `clearinghouse checkpoint' is now `clearinghouse initiate'.

       (dj) Cleaned up the new `clearinghouse' commands, particularly
            `verify'.

       (dk) Added `secval status'.
A very simple addition.

       (dl) The `acl show' command describes the causes of UUID's being
            displayed instead of names more completely.

       (dm) Added a `-xattrs' option to `principal', `group',
            `organization' and `registry show' operations.  Some also get a
            `-all'.

       (dn) Added `SAMEAS' routing specifier.

Applies to the `log' ref page.

       (do) Added the `-uuid' option to `endpoint show'.

util_signal needs to be thread safe:
 * It should include the DCE Threads wrappers
 * HAVE_SIGACTION should be #defined for it's compilation
   In fact we might just want to assume we have it (DCE coding style guide)
   and remove all the code that assumes we don't (the #else's)
 * There needs to be locking around the global variable numInterps
   Not sure about: signalsReceived and signalTrapCmds

Also the function declarations should all be ANSI style and not old style.
The internal prototypes should be ANSI prototypes and not need _ANSI_ARGS()

[8/22/94 public]
All the above have been done except putting the locking around the global
variables. In light of other thread-safety problems currently in dcecp,
this is not important. Changed to a doc bug to be mentioned in the
porting guide.

[08/23/94 public]
Assigned to writer Doug Weir (Porting Guide owner).

[10/26/94 public]
The information mentioned by John just above is now in Chapter 3 of

	dcecp's "user create" command creates a user and creates a CDS
directory for the user. It then sets the acl for the directory. Supposedly,
the user should now be able to create entries under this directory.

	The problem is, the user will be able to create objects under the
directory, but not directories, since he needs write permission to the
clearinghouse to be able to create directories.

	It is not as simple as adding an acl to grant user xxx the permision
to the clearinghouse. Imagine hundreds of users in a cell, you should not have
the acl for the clearinghouse to list all the users. It has to be group.

[8/8/94 public]
I've changed this to a doc bug.  Ward please include something to the
following effect in the section on customizing (or maybe using) the user
create command.

As we ship DCE 1.1 the user create command will set the ACL on the
/.:/users/<username> directory so that users can insert things.  This alone
lets them insert objects and links.  To insert directories (a much more
expensive proposition) you also need write access to the clearinghouse that
will hold the directory.  The user create script does NOT change this
because: 

 * We don't know what the name of the clearinghouse is, though it could
   default to the clearinghouse holding /.:/users/<username>
 * If every user is going to have write access to the clearinghouse, why
   not just put {any_other rw-t-} on the clearinghouse.  FYI the default
   is: 
	dcecp> acl show /.:/absolut_ch
	{unauthenticated r--t-}
	{group subsys/dce/cds-admin rwdtc}
	{group subsys/dce/cds-server rwdtc}
	{any_other r--t-}
 * Directories are expensive and perhaps the admin does not want users
   creating them.

Any of the above could be changed by admin policy and the user create
script modified to allow for that policy.  The section on customizing
should mention this.  The section on *using* this command should have a big
bold note describing that in the *default* config users will not be able to
add directories.

[08/09/94 public]
Assigned this bug to Ward Rosenberry.
Please also make any corresponding changes to the user.8dce ref page
in the Command Reference.

[10/05/94 public]
Added necessary information to the 'user create' and 'extending scripts'
sections of the 'User' task object chapter in the admin gd. I'll set this
CR to verified after the final review approves the new material.

[10/26/94 public]
This change was verified by Howard Melman.

According to spec and man page, dcecp should accept multiple commands
separated by ;'s, all in quotes.  Only last command is getting executed:

pomerol /usr/users/hester 37 DCE> dcecp -c "dir help;prin help"
catalog             View a list of all the names of principals in the registry
create              Create a dce principal
delete              Delete a principal from the registry
modify              Change the information about a principal
rename              Rename the specified principal.
show                Show an attribute list of the specified principal
help                Print summary of command-line options and abort.
operations          Return valid operations for command.

pomerol /usr/users/hester 38 DCE> dcecp -c "dir help;prin help;log help"
list                Returns serviceability components registered by the server.
modify              Changes serviceability routing specifications of a server.
show                Returns serviceability routing settings for a server.
help                Print summary of command-line options and abort.
operations          Return valid operations for command.

[6/6/94 public]
Well, not exactly. When Tcl evaluates a procedure or a multi-command
line, the 'result' (what the command returns to the user for output)
is whatever the last command output. Each of the commands is being
executed, but only the output of the last command is being output.

> dcecp -c "login cell_admin -p dcecp; dts modify -minservers 3; logout"

This command would not work if the login didn't happen.

There is another bug that I found in verifying this. There is a 
bad variable scoping problem. 

> dcecp -c "set x 4; set y 5; set x"
4
> dcecp -c "set x 4; set y 5; set x; set y"
5
> dcecp -c "set x 4; set y 5; set x; set y; expr ($x + $y)"
x: Undefined variable.

I'm going to keep this open until we have a handle on all the
issues here.

[kevins 6/6/94 public] 
Well, not exactly. In this example:
 
> dcecp -c "set x 4; set y 5; set x; set y; expr ($x + $y)"
x: Undefined variable.

The shell is attempting to evaluate the $x and $y. Single quotes will
prevent this from occurring. For instance:

> dcecp -c 'set x 4; set y 5; set x; set y; expr ($x + $y)'
9

produces the correct result. 

However in the previous problem originally reported by Martha:

> dcecp -c "dir help;prin help;log help"

This particular problem can be overcome by:

> dcecp -c "puts [dir help]; puts [prin help]; puts [log help]"

Ugly but it works. At least it doesn't give you a "syntax error"

[6/6/94 public]
Cancelled.  The output problem is a standard Tcl misconception that
we'll have to fix with documentation.  Commands don't write to stdout,
they store their value in result.  When you use ;'s on a command line
the last command wins.

The scoping problem seems to be understood.

[6/13/94 public]
Re-opened and changed to doc so we make sure it gets fixed in the documenation.

[6/13/94 public]
Ward, I'll be sure to give you comments on this in my review.

[10/26/94 public]

We partially fixed this problem by adding the following information to
Section 1.3.2 "Invoking dcecp Operations" in the Administration Guide core
volume:

Be careful entering multiple operations using the \*Ldcecp\*O command
with the \*L-c\*O option because operation results return to the
\*Ldcecp\*O interpreter, not to the shell.  An operation like the
following returns the results of just the last operation (\*Lgroup list
users\*O) to the shell.
.oS
% \*Ldcecp -c "group list staff; group list managers; group list users"\*C
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/P_Pestana
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/R_Parsons
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/L_Jones
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/S_Preska
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/N_Long
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/D_Witt
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/C_Pilat
 .
 .
 .
%
.oE

This needs the additional work of adding the following workaround to the
text:

"This particular problem can be overcome by:

> dcecp -c "puts [dir help]; puts [prin help]; puts [log help]"

Ugly but it works. At least it doesn't give you a "syntax error"

This CR work is being deferred until DCE 1.2.

[2/9/96 public]

We'll re-open this one for the couple lines that sill need
to go into the Admin Guide.  For the record, they are

   "This particular problem can be overcome by:"

   > dcecp -c "puts [dir help]; puts [prin help]; puts [log help]"

To avoid OT clutter, this bug will serve for both the Admin Guide
and the manpages.  millett@apollo.hp.com will make the required
manpage changes and put a note here when that part is done.

[2/20/96 public]

Margaret Taft gets the Admin Guide bugs.

[3/1/96 public]

This information was added to the manpages in the HP markup,
so will be in the OSF tree soon.  Margaret still needs to
make the Admin Guide changes.

[6/5/96 public]

The changes to the dcecp manpage have been made.  All that remains
are the changes to the Admin Guide.

[9/19/96 public]

Status changed to verified. Fix verified by truitt.
