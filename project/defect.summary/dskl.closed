The diskless component is no longer part of DCE. The release notes
should remove any mention of diskless except to say that it is
no longer supported and its documentation has been removed.

This CR covers removal of all diskless documentation from the DCE doc set.
The agreement between engineering and doc folk is that the diskless
documentation should simply be removed and not put into the supp_docs
directory.

[4/11/94 public]
I have now removed all disless documentation from the regular doc set,
*except* the release notes.  The main books affected are the Administration
Guide, Command Reference, Introduction to DCE, and Porting and Testing
Guide.  Whoever prepares the 1.1 release notes should get rid of any
mention of diskless, except to say that it is no longer supported and its
documentation has been removed.
I did fix all cross-references to diskless documentation that I could find.
I also fixed a number of figures to remove references to diskless support
or to things that applied only to diskless systems.
One other issue remains.  In the course of this work, I removed
documentation for two DFS options that were documented to apply only to
diskless systems.  These are the -rootcell option to dfsd and the -global
option to fts crmount.  I commented out all DFS documentation rather than
simply remove it so that any errors I made could be corrected easily.  The
following files are affected:
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/2_issues_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/6_ftavail_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/8_cachemgr_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_ref/man8dfs/dfsd.8dfs
./dce_books/admin_ref/man8dfs/fts_crmount.8dfs
I have sent these files to Jeff Kaminski at Transarc.  Jeff has offered to
review the changes.  His first reaction was that the options should be
documented anyway.  If so, someone will have to come up with some alternate
wording that does not mention diskless systems.

[4/20/94 public]
I reviewed the five DFS files for Bob.  In each case, I rewrote some text
as a result of the diskless removal.  In some cases, I rewrote an option
description; in others, I rewrote an example or some descriptive text.
When in doubt, I had new text reviewed by Craig Everhart or Pervaze Akhtar,
and we are all comfortable with the resulting wording.
All diskless references have been removed from the following files:
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/2_issues_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/6_ftavail_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_gd/dfs/dfs/8_cachemgr_dfs.gpsml
./dce_books/admin_ref/man8dfs/dfsd.8dfs
./dce_books/admin_ref/man8dfs/fts_crmount.8dfs
I changed this defect to verified; I think I was the obstacle to this state,
and from the DFS doc perspective, it can now be closed.  I included Hal on
the cc list due to Bob's recent departure.
Changed Interest List CC from `jeff@transarc.com' to `jeff@transarc, 
 hal@osf.org' 
Changed Status from `open' to `verified' 
Filled in Fixed In Baseline with `1.1' 
Filled in Affected File with `See Description' 
Added field Transarc Deltas with value `' 
Added field Transarc Herder with value `' 
Added field Transarc Status with value `closed'

[4/21/94 public]

I opened a new CR to cover removing diskless info from
Release Notes. I'll close this CR once I verify changes
in next doc build.

[09/15/94 public]

The Admin Reference Description file currently does not include the
diskless reference pages, so these pages do not get built into the book.
This was done because we do not publish these pages in the Prentice Hall
version of the book.  However, we should include the pages on the version
that goes on the tape.  Therefore I would recommend that we specify them in
the Description file, but put a comment before the entry/ies indicating that
they should be commented out for Prentice Hall production.  It would also
be possible to use a PH ifdef, but that might be going too far.  We should
also check to ensure that these pages get built into the online man pages.

[7/13/93 public]
Changed to "verified".  These files are built into the online man 
pages independently of whether or not they are specified in the
Description file for the Admin Ref.  So, that part's OK.

I added the Diskless Support Service reference pages to the 
Description file as the penultimate chapter in the Admin Ref, 
and also added comment lines stating that these ref pages are not 
to be included in Prentice-Hall versions.  I also adjusted the
chapter division pages (chapter.6 and chapter.7 in the chapters
subdirectory) to match the new chapter sequence.

Section 2.5

Change section:

	"Hardware support for secure booting would involve a way of
knowing

	* The name of the diskless machine
	* the name of each boot server
	* the diskless machines's Kerberos private key

To:

	"Hardware support for secure booting would provide a way of
knowing

	* The principal name of the diskless machine
	* The principal name of each boot server
	* The authentication key for the diskless machine's principal


The word "principle" is used incorrectly in place of "principal" on 
the following pages:

	3-3 	(standard type block, variable name and comment)
	3-4	Variable name table

Throughout Chapter 4 machine names are used fairly loosely.  I assume
that these names are IP hostnames - but nothing in the text indicates
this.  I could reasonably assume that these names are the CDS name
for the host or the principal name for the host.  This should be
more clearly specified.  An example is from section 4.4.2.1 
	
	dsw_adm addfile -server s -file f

	where s is the name of the swap server host...
