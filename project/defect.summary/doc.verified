This CR is being opened to track two errors found in server.8dce.
The following correspondence between me and Jim Truitt (my questions
come first, and are followed by Jim's responses) describe the prob-
lems...


> 1. In the server.8dce manpage, there is a complaint
>    about the representation of the output of the
>    server catalog operation. The original Transarc
>    item says that the output of the command should
>    be:
> 
>         /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver not
>         /.:/hosts/foster/config/try_tserver
> 
>    But currently the manpage has the following:
> 
>         dcecp> server catalog /.:/hosts/foster
>         /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvconf/try_tserver 
>         dcecp> 
> 
>    (I.e., only the single line of output.) So who is right?

Here the manpage is incorrect.  The fix was to change

      /.:/hosts/foster/config/try_tserver  (which is an incorrect name)

to

      /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver  (the correct name)

But the fix got messed up, and instead of 'srvrconf', it currently
says 'srvconf'.

So the fix here is to change

      /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvconf/try_tserver

to

      /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver

> 2. There is a Transarc item saying that the "server create" example
>    in server.8dce should not have in its output the "{flags {}}"
>    line, and that the "-starton" line should have braces in it, i.e.

> 
>    , not
> 
>         -starton boot auto explicit failure
> 
>    as in the manpage right now. Who is right?

The manpage is still wrong.  The 'starton' value should have
braces around it for sure.

The following comes from the original comments to CR 13246, which
was duped to 13377 (marked "fix"). The particular defect described
below seems still to be present. The original description comes
from Maria Wadlow at Transarc; it is followed by my own (bracketed
and indented) comments, made after 13246 was duped to 13377.

	The "gid" attribute is described as having a "value" argument
	when, in fact, the argument is an "integer"; "integer" is the
	term used elsewhere for this type of argument.

              [The complaint is about the name of the argument, i.e.
               that it's called <value> and not <integer>, and that
               this is misleading.]

[6/21/96 public]

   Right.  There are actually a few things in the ATTRIBUTES section
   that are wrong...

      "alias value" should be "alias {yes | no}"

      "gid value" should be "gid integer"

      "inprojlist value" should be "inprojlist {yes | no}"

   In the 'description' part of 'cell backup', just before the 'Privileges
   Required' section, is a paragraph that contains this text:

      Note that you need the necessary permissions in the remote
      cell.  (Refer to the cell object reference page for the
      required privileges.)  This command returns an empty string
      on success.

   Instead of "cell object reference page", it should say "registry

	The "-default" option description says, "When you use the
	-default option, all of the other options except -member are
	ignored." but the "-member" option says, "If you use the
	-default option, this option is ignored."  One of these
	statements can not be correct.

                 [The following statement is made under "rpcprofile
                  add": "If you specify the -default option, the only
                  other option that can be supplied is -member." And
                  the statement "When you use the -default option, all
                  of the other options except -member are illegal" is
                  repeated in several places. And the second statement,
                  "If you use the -default option, this option [i.e.
                  -member] is ignored" still appears. So this change

	"The version is optional..."
	The version appears not to be optional.

               [The complaint seems to be in regard to the description
                of the keytab create operation. But in fact the "version"
                parameter is nowhere mentioned at all (either as optional
                or as required) in any of the synopses for "create" that
                I can see. The change called for here has not been made;
                but aside from that, there seems to be an additional
                defect, namely the absence of "version" from the "create"
                synopses. Note that "version" is mentioned in the descrip-
                tions, so it seems clear that it should be in the synopses.]

	The example that uses the dcecp string syntax lists the
	"-interface" arguement incorrectly.  There should be a space
	between the UUID and the version, not a comma, in the string
	syntax.

              [I'm not sure about this one. The reference is to the
               DATA STRUCTURES section of the manpage. Two ways of
               specifying an interface ID are given, and this complaint
               is about the first form. The UUID and version are separated
               by a space in dcecp string syntax, but here we are not
               talking about dcecp syntax, but rather about the old
               rpccp-acceptable form (e.g., see rpccp_add_mapping.8rpc,
               where this form is given). Now, whether this form is
               also acceptable to dcecp I don't know; by giving both
               forms here, the authors of the manpage seem to
               think it is: The dcecp string syntax is explicitly
               given (in the right form, I assume) just below the pas-
               sage under question here. So, to sum up, although I think
               this complaint may be in error, I'm opening the bug to
               be on the safe side.]

        are reversed.  The dcecp string syntax should be the one with
        the braces.

The current synopsis for this command is:

   clock set [dts_entity]
      {-to DTS_timestamp [-abruptly -epoch epoch_number] [-bypass] |
       -epoch epoch_number}

When '-to' is used, the '-abruptly' and '-epoch' options must be used
together, or not at all:

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show]
      dcecp>

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show] -abruptly -epoch 0
      dcecp>

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show] -abruptly
      Error: '-epoch' option not specified.
      dcecp>

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show] -epoch 1
      Error: '-abruptly' option not specified.
      dcecp>

So the '-abruptly' and '-epoch' options should not be separated.

However, the syntax above implies that '-bypass' can be used standalone,
or in combination with '-abruptly' and '-epoch' (when '-to' is specified).
This is NOT the case:

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show] -bypass
      dcecp>

      dcecp> clock set -to [clock show] -bypass -abrutply -epoch 1
      Error: When using '-bypass', other options are not allowed.
      dcecp>

As you can see, it can be used alone, but not in combination.  This
makes the synopsis incorrect as described, but not for the reasons
listed below.  Change this line of the synopsis from:

      {-to DTS_timestamp [-abruptly -epoch epoch_number] [-bypass] |

to

      {-to DTS_timestamp [-abruptly -epoch epoch_number | -bypass] |

which means you can use '-to' alone, or you can use '-to' with
the '-abruptly/-epoch' combination, or you '-to' with '-bypass'.
But '-bypass' cannot be used with the other options.

This change should be applied to both places in the dcecp_clock manpage.

[6/19/96 public]
Status changed to cancel. According to developers here, the 
current syntax for the -abruptly and -epoch options is correct 
as it stands.

        The "-epoch" option takes an "epoch_number" argument.  Also,
        the "-abruptly" option and the "-epoch" option should be
        listed separately, as "[-abruptly] [-epoch epoch_number]"

              [The "epoch_number" argument has been added. However,
               the "-abruptly" and "-epoch" options have not been

The following comes from the original comments to CR 13238, which
was duped to 13377 (marked "fix"). The particular defect described
below seems still to be present. The original description comes
from Maria Wadlow at Transarc; it is followed by my own (bracketed
and indented) comments, made after 13238 was duped to 13377.

        "server_name_list"
        According to a developer who looked at the code, this is
        command can not actually handle a list, but can only handle a
        single name.  The description of the server_name_list argument
        should also be modified from "This is a list of one or more
        simple names for..." ("of" was misspelled) to "This is a
        simple name for..."  The description of the "cdscache delete"
        command should also be modified from "...argument is a list of
        one or more simple names given..." to "...argument is a simple
        name given..."  The description the "cdscache show" command
        should be similarly modified.

            ["of" is no longer misspelled. The other changes haven't
             been made.]

Here is a transcript of the problem:

        acl_edit /.../slab.dce.transarc.com/hosts/slab/config
        sec_acl_edit> l

        # SEC_ACL for /.../slab.dce.transarc.com/hosts/slab/config:
        # Default cell = /.../slab.dce.transarc.com
        unauthenticated:-r--
        user:hosts/slab/self:crws
        any_other:-r--
        sec_acl_edit> g
        Granted permissions: crws
        sec_acl_edit> m unauthenticated:crws
        sec_acl_edit> co
        ERROR: permission not valid for this acl (dce / sec)
        sec_acl_edit>

Here I am loged in as "self" and have change permission, but
cannot change the acl. 

As a sanity check, I tried it via dcecp also.

        dcecp> acl check /.:/hosts/slab/config
        crws
        dcecp> acl show /.:/hosts/slab/config
        {unauthenticated -r--}
        {user hosts/slab/self crws}
        {any_other -r--}
        dcecp> acl modify /.:/hosts/slab/config \
                -change {unauthenticated crws}
        Error: permission not valid for this acl
        dcecp>

Same problem.

(By the way, no problem with this in my Solaris cell.)

I have marked this to be highly visible because I believe the
problem prevents a user from creating a keytab file for an
application.

[6/6/96 public]

I believe this problem is showing up because you have not run
dced_acl_patcher (located in /opt/dcelocal/etc). Please follow
the steps below before you try the above steps:

su as root
dce_login cell_admin ...
kill dced process and wait until it goes away
start dced with option -r, i.e., dced -r
wait for 30 seconds to let it get started
Run dced_acl_patcher, i.e., dced_acl_patcher (assuming its in your path)

I've marked this as a doc bug as it needs to be documented in 
proper places if not done already.

If dced_acl_patcher does not help then please change it back to code

[6/6/96 public]

That worked. But, why leave this hanging to bite people? It
shouldn't be necessary to go through this esoterica just to
create a keytab, should it?


bug.

[6/6/96 public]
Good! For a cell with multiple machines/replicated secd's you need
to do this only on master secd machine. This step is required to
ensure secure access including keytab.

[6/7/96 public]
Assigned to HP, changed priority and severity. I put "admin_gd"
as the sub-component, but perhaps there is a place to put this
information in the acl.8dce (i.e., the dcecp ACL object) manpage
as well. And what is dced_acl_patcher? There is no mention of
it anywhere in the documentation that I can see. Should it be
mentioned in the Release Notes?

[8/9/96 public]

The CR required changes to /dce_books/command_ref/8dce/dced.8dce 
(the addition of the -r option).  The admin guide also needs to 
be updated with the acl_patcher info; then it can be marked as fixed and verified.  
The changes to dced were verfied by lmm.

[10/1/96 public]

Status changed to verified. Fix verified by lmm. Added dced_acl_patcher
description and list of ACLs before/after running dced_acl_patcher.

Several idl features arrived too late to be documented in the OSF DCE
1.2.1 docs. The release notes for these features are as follows:
...\" 
...\" The following feature is new in DCE 1.2.1
...\" 
.H 3 "Automatic Binding Enhancement"
.P
.iX "host profile"
.iX "RPC_DEFAULT_ENTRY"
When a client uses the automatic binding method, 
DCE must use the name service to obtain binding information.
However, the client host must have a starting entry 
from which to begin the namespace search.
If the \*LRPC_DEFAULT_ENTRY\*O environment variable 
is defined on the client host, DCE uses the entry in that variable
to obtain binding information. 
If \*LRPC_DEFAULT_ENTRY\*O is not defined, 
DCE looks for binding information from the host's 
name service profile.
...\" 
...\" The following information differs slightly from what's documented in
...\" the App Dev Guide Core volume.
...\" 
...\" 
.H 3 "Enumeration in IDL"
.P
An IDL enumeration provides names for integers.  It is specified as
follows:
.oS
\*Lenum {\*O\*Videntifier[\*O= \*Vinteger], ...\*O\*L}\*O
.oE
.P
Each identifier in an enumeration is assigned an integer, either
explicitly in the interface or automatically by the IDL compiler.  If
all the identifiers are unassigned, the IDL compiler begins assigning
0 (zero) to the first identifier, 1 to the next identifier, and so on.
If an unassigned identifier follows an assigned one, the compiler
restarts number assignment with the next consecutive integer.  An
enumeration can have up to 32,767 identifiers.
.P
Assignments can be made in any order, and multiple identifiers can
have the same value. For example:
.oS
typedef  enum {
 SHOVEL = 9, AX, MATTOCK = 3, PITCHFORK, SPADE = 9
 } yard_tools;
/* values assigned: SHOVEL:9, AX:10, MATTOCK:3, PITCHFORK:4, SPADE:9 */
.oE
...\" 
...\" The following information discusses a new feature in DCE 1.2.1
...\" 
.H 3 "The client_memory ACF Attribute"
.P
.iX "client_memory ACF attribute"
While marshaling parameters, the client stub uses built-in 
routines to manage memory. 
You can use the \*Lclient_memory\*O attribute to specify different 
memory allocation and free routines. 
The \*Lclient_memory\*O attribute has the following syntax 
in the ACF header:
.P
.iS
\*L[client_memory(\*O\*Vmalloc_routine, free_routine\*O\*L)] interface\*O \*Vidl
_interface_name\*O
.iE
.P
The routines you specify must have the same respective
procedure declarations as the system's 
\*Lmalloc(\|)\*O and \*Lfree(\|)\*O routines. 
.P
Applications need to manage memory consistently, 
so if your application needs to do other memory allocation, 
be sure to use the same routines you specified 
with the \*Lclient_memory\*O attribute.
.P
You can use the \*Lclient_memory\*O attribute in conjunction 
with RPC stub support API routines such as 
\*Lrpc_sm_set_client_alloc_free(\|)\*O and
\*Lrpc_sm_swap_client_alloc_free(\|)\*O.

Linked lists are marshalled and unmarshalled using recursion.  This can
cause the stack size to grow.  If done in the main thread (as is the case
with simple clients that don't spawn threads to do RPC's) this is okay --
the system will grow the stack automatically.  If done in a server, where
the thread-stack often cannot grow automatically, large lists can cause
the server to crash.

We should (more clearly?) document this limitation and explain work-arounds
such as using transmit_as and converting the list into an array or such.

The second paragraph of the rpc_mgmt_set_com_timeout manpage
description is confusing.  It says:
	After the initial relationship is established, subsequent
	communications for the binding handle can revert to not less
	than the default timeouts for the protocol service.  This
	means that after setting a short initial timeout, establishing
	a connection, calls in progress are not timed out any sooner
	than the default.
A paragraph was added at the end of the description to clarify that
the behavior is different depending on whether it is a
connection-oriented RPC or a datagram RPC, but the above paragraph is
still confusing and it's encountered first.  After reading the
paragraph at the end, this paragraph seems to apply only to datagram
RPCs, but it doesn't say that.  Perhaps this section would be improved
if the differences between the protocol sequences was discussed
directly in one place.  A developer here explains it this way:
The answer differs for TCP and UDP connections, of course.  And for
each, the answer is different depending on whether you're starting an
RPC or if the RPC was already in progress (or, in the CN case, if you
are recycling an existing connection).
 
TCP (ncacn_ip_tcp):
        Initial connection: we either try once using the OS default
		timeout\ , or we retry forever if the
		rpc_mgmt_com_timeout is set to
                rpc_c_binding_infinite_timeout.
        After connection is made: timeouts are controlled by the OS.
                Binding timeout is ignored.
UDP (ncadg_ip_udp):
        All timeouts are controlled by the rpc_mgmt_com_timeout value.
        Changing the value will cause future timeouts to change (ie:
        something which is already sleeping won't get woken up).  But
        new RPCs on the same handle should use the new timeout values.
 
I think the man page is warning that its only really sensible to
change the timeout on a handle at the beginning.  Changing it on the
fly won't always do what you want.

change did not describe the implementation details of the 
different protocols because the calls are designed to be

In the section called proc Lets You Create New Commands, the example
of allowing you to specify a default value for an argument using a
nested list structure in the argument list is incorrect.  The text
says that the example will have the second argument default to 1 if no
argument is supplied.  The example:
	proc _attr_show {attr {value "unset"}} {
		puts "$attr is $value"
	}
would default to "unset" not 1.  It should be:
	proc _attr_show {attr {value 1}} {
		puts "$attr is $value"
	}
in order for the second argument to default to 1.

	Similarly, dcecp uses double quotes and braces to group
	elements into structures called lists.  Lists are a special
	way to group elements so that dcecp can correctly parse
	commands and other data like return values.
A more precise description might be worded as follows:
	Similarly, dcecp uses double quotes and braces to group
	elements into structures.  Double quotes allow elements that
	would usually be parsed separately to be grouped and treated
	as a single element.  Braces are used to group elements into a

First, all examples of the history command in dcecp should be listing
"history" as the most recent command.

Second, in the section called Editing Command Lines With the history
Command, the following example is incorrect:
	dcecp>  history
		1 directory show /.:/printers
		2 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer1
		3 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer2
		4 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer3
		5 directory show /.:/printers
	dcecp>  hi s -2 printer3 printer4
	object add /.:/printers/ascii_printer4
The example should be as follows:
	dcecp>  history
		1 directory show /.:/printers
		2 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer1
		3 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer2
		4 object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer3
		5 directory show /.:/printers
		6 history
	dcecp>  hi s printer3 printer4 -3
	object create /.:/printers/ascii_printer4
The history command should show up as #6 in the history output, the
event number should be changed from -2 to -3 to account for the
history command in the output, the event number belongs at the end of
the command, and the command being re-executed is an "object create"
command, not an "object add" command.

The section called Editing the Current Command Line should include
some discussion of the behavior of key bindings with dcecp.  For
example, after the lists of control characters and escape sequences,
the following text could be included:

	In some cases, existing terminal key bindings will take
	precedence over these dcecp control keys.  In particular, the
	bindings used for erase, kill, eof, intr, quit, and susp in
	your environment will supercede any dcecp bindings for those
	same control keys.
	In most instances, control keys will not be interpreted by the
	terminal but will be passed through to dcecp.  There are a few
	exceptions though, most notably lnext, or "literal next,"
	which quotes the next character typed.  When you type the
	control key that is bound to lnext it is interpreted by the
	terminal, which will pass the next character typed through to
	dcecp.

[4/25/96 public]
According to developers here, some of the descriptions of the required
permissions are incorrect in the table called dcecp Program Commands
and Required Permissions.  The incorrect permissions are below,
followed by suggested corrections:
directory modify
	Write permission to the directory for which you want to add
	(-add option) or change (-change option) the attribute or
	attribute value.
	Delete permission to the directory for which you want to
	remove the attribute or attribute value (-remove option).
    should say:
	Write permission to the directory for which you want to add
	(-add option), change (-change option), or remove (-remove
	option) the attribute or attribute value.
directory remove
	Write permission to the parent directory of the child pointer
	(-member option) you want to remove.
    should say:
	Delete permission to the child pointer (-member option) you
	want to remove or administer permission to the parent
	directory.
directory show
	Read permission to the directory whose attributes you want to
	list.  If you specify a wildcard directory name, you also need
	read permission to the directory's parent directory.
	For a replica of a directory (-replica option)--Read
	permission to the directory of which the replica is a member.
	For a child directory (-member)\(emRead permission to
	the child.
    should say:
	Read permission to the directory whose attributes you want to
	list.
	For a replica of a directory (-replica option)--Read
	permission to the directory of which the replica is a member.
	For a child directory (-member)\*(emRead permission to
	the child.
The wildcard stuff appears to be leftover from cdscp.  Note the
missing * in the em-dash SML command (I've omitted the other SML
commands for clarity).
object modify
	Write permission to the object entry for which you want to add
	(-add option) or change (-change option) the attribute or
	attribute value.
	Delete permission to the object entry, or administer
	permission to the parent directory of the object for which you
	want to remove (-remove option) the attribute or attribute
	value.
    should say:
	Write permission to the object entry for which you want to add
	(-add option), change (-change option), or remove (-remove
	option) the attribute or attribute value.
clearinghouse show
	Read permission to the clearinghouse whose attributes you want
	to list.  If you specify a wildcard clearinghouse name, you
	also need read permission to the cell root directory.
    should say:
	Read permission to the clearinghouse whose attributes you want
	to list.

This CR is being created (after the event) to record various
changes that were made in the dcecp manpages to reflect additions
that were made in the HP 1.1 version, but which had to be retro-
actively incorporated into OSF's 1.2 baseline. I will update
this report with a short list of the changes that were made.

This CR is for HP's editorial and technical changes to the 
dcecp manpages.

[2/28/96 public]
changed fix by from 1.2 for 1.2.2

[3/1/96 public]
Updating responsible engineer and trying to run 'ot'
using the '-s' option.  So if you didn't get email
about this change, it worked.  :-)

[4/2/96 public]
HP made its first drop of manpages in October '95.  These were
for the 1.2 code base.  In February '95 we took a drop of these
manpages back from OSF, expecting the same as we sent, but found
that not only were some format changes made (which were good),
but some of the technical changes we made were un-done, for whatever
reason.

We've just completed a second thorough review of the manpages, and
will drop them to OSF soon.  We've re-fixed all of what was un-done
the last time, and expect that this time, nothing in them will change
without the approval or review of the component owner or his minions.

The new OT just opened, 13423, is a good example.  The manpage that
was dropped to OSF is correct, but the one in the 1.2 tree Maria
is looking at does not have at least one of the changes.  I'm marking
that OT as a dup of this one, and putting Maria's concerns here.

So, before this OT is marked 'fix', make sure the 'maxtktlife'
parameter is STILL described correctly in dcecp_registry.8dce,
as 'relative time', as it was in the 10/95 manpage drop.

[6/4/96 pubilc]
Marked as fixed.  Changes verified by truitt.

The "account modify" examples on page 30-15 in the Admin Gd-Core are
incorrect.  Instead of "mycurrentpwd," it should have "mypwd."
dcecp> account modify smitty -password $p -mypwd -dce-
In addition, the bad example in the Warning paragraph will not work
because "acct" is not a valid abbreviation for "account."

The example to display the contents of a clearinghouse on page 17-3 of
the Admin Guide-Core is incorrect.  The document shows:

dcecp> clearinghouse show /.:/<name>_CH CDS_CHDirectories -clear
However, the clearinghouse ref page does not list a "-clear" option
for the show subcommand and CDS_CHDirectories is not a valid argument.
The developer reproduces the behavior:
dcecp> clearinghouse show /.:/mough_ch CDS_CHDirectories -clear
Error: Unrecognized argument 'CDS_CHDirectories'.
dcecp> clearinghouse show /.:/mough_ch {CDS_CHDirectories} -clear
Error: Unrecognized argument 'CDS_CHDirectories'.

In ot13404 (which is being closed as a duplicate), wwang points out
these same 'clearinghouse show' example errors, and also asks that the
Admin Guide better stress that '-attribute' does not allow the returning
of a single attribute, and to do that you should use the 'attrlist'
command in conjunction with the 'clearinghouse show' command.

[2/16/96 public]
In the ERRORS section of the man page for sec_rgy_plcy_get_info, the
return value sec_rgy_object_not_found is listed as one of the return
values issued by the function.  The cause listed for this return value
is "The registry server could not find the specified organization."
This return value is also returned when the organization does exist,
but does not have its own policy.  The man page should state the other
reason for this return value.
The developer who reported this created a small test program.  Passing
this program the organization "none" did reproduce the behavior
(i.e. the organization existed, but he still received the
sec_rgy_object_not_found return value).
Added field Transarc Deltas with value `15857' 
Added field Transarc Status with value `open'

"cell ping" man page says:

"If called with no option it pings the master security server, each CDS
server that has a master clearinghouse, and ..."

What is a master clearinghouse? I would say that a master clearinghouse is
the one that contains any master directories, not just the root directory.

The code uses "directory show $CELLNAME" and checks the CDS_Replicas entry 
for the Replica_Type. If it is Master, it thinks the clearinghouse is the 
master clearinghouse. If it is not, it thinks the clearinghouse is NOT a
master clearinghouse. But this only checks the root directory. The 
clearinghouse that has the readonly root dorectory can have a master dir
/.:/XYZ in it.

So either the code should check every directory, or it should abandon this
concept. Personally, I would abandon it, since there is no master cds
server, there shouldn't be a concept of master clearinghouse.

[2/7/96 public]

There is confusion with regard to what a 'master' clearinghouse is,
and rightly so.  In the security world, the difference between 'master'
and 'replica' is well defined.  In the CDS world, any clearinghouse can
be a master to some directories, read-only to others, thus confusing
the distinction.

In dcecp, the confusion is supported in some places when the concept
of a 'replica clearinghouse' is discussed.  What it really means is
a 'replicated directory' in a clearinghouse.  Look at the internals
of how 'directory show' uses '-replica' and '-clearinghouse' and you
get an idea of where the confusion can come from.

What 'cell ping' (with no options, and disregarding DTS for now) is
trying to do is ping what it thinks to be the master security server
(found using some 'registry' operations) and what it thinks is the
clearinghouse that holds the write-copy of /.: (or whatever cellname
is being operated on).  There is only one clearinghouse that has this
distinction, and in 'directory show /.:' shows up as:

    {{CH_UUID 27320196-5a61-11cf-aa43-0800097da8e0}
     {CH_Name /.../mgm_test_config/bagomon_ch}
     {Replica_Type Master}
     {Tower {ncadg_ip_udp 15.22.51.68}}
     {Tower {ncacn_ip_tcp 15.22.51.68}}}}

In the 'cell' manpage, this is what it means by the "Master" clearinghouse.

You can use the '-replica' option to ping the rest of the clearinghouses in
the cell, as well as the rest of the security replicas.

This is a doc bug.  There is no problem pinging just the master security
server and the clearinghouse that contains the master copy of the cell
directory.  We should have the 'cell' manpage better define what it
is pinging when no options are specified.

[2/7/96 public]
Jim looks to be correct her.  The history is that cell ping would do
what you want it to do.  Is my cell running?  What does this mean?
Can I do anything I would want to in normal operations.  Can I
read/write everything.  So that translates to, are the masters of
everything available.  That would be the master secd and any CDS
server that had a master replica.  But (as the footnote in rfc 42.3
says) it's too hard to find this info out from cds.   There are
options to ping all servers (-replica) and all machines (-clients)

The oringinal compromise (for CDS) was that with no options it would
ping the each cds server but that is very similar to the behavior of
the command with -replica.  Another compromise would be to ping the
server with the master replica of the root directory.  Seems
reasonable, but not quite semantically correct (is this info really
useful to someone vs always wanting to use -replica).  Changes to the
root directory should be very rare.

[2/7/96 public]

I was thinking whether a doc change will do. For the same reason that Howard
mentioned above, I thought it is not that useful and casuses confusion.
I thought we might as well just ping all cds server and leave "-replicas"
for security servers only.

Even we decide to make it a doc bug and change the doc, I would suggest not
to use the word "master clearinghouse". Just say what it does (ping the cds
server that hosts the master root replica).

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:

                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}
 
       It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

Status changed to fix.
Most of these were fixed by HP fixes and rcb edits, but bad DTE 
coding on on example remained.

Following is a list of various defects found in the name.8dce
manpage by Maria Wadlow at Transarc and communicated to us here
at OSF. These defects are in the course of being fixed at this
moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially
register the changes...

The "Description" sections of sec_rgy_attr_lookup_no_expand(3sec) and
sec_rgy_attr_lookup_by_id(3sec) state that "If cursor is uninitialized, the
server begins processing the query with the first attribute that satisfies the
search criteria."  This is incorrect.  If cursor is uninitialized, the
behaviour is not defined.

The RELATED INFORMATION sections in the following manpages refer to
incorrect or non-existent routines. These should be corrected or removed
from the manpages.


1. The dce_acl_resolve_by_name(3sec) and dce_acl_resolve_by_uuid(3sec)
   manpages refer to a non-existent routine "dce_db_std_header_fetch(3dce)".


2. The sec_key_mgmt_change_key(3sec) and sec_key_mgmt_gen_rand_key(3sec)
   manpages refer to a non-existent routine "sec_key_mgmt_generate_key(3sec)".


3. The sec_attr_trig_query(3sec) manpage refers to a non-existent routine
   "sec_attr_trig_cursor_init(3sec)".

[10/12/95 public]

It looks as though in (1) above, "dce_db_std_header_fetch(3dce)" should
be changed to "dce_db_header_fetch(3dce)", and in (2),
"sec_key_mgmt_generate_key(3sec)" should be changed to
"sec_key_mgmt_gen_rand_key(3sec)". What (3) should be I can't tell. There
really seems to be a routine missing.

[7/31/96 public]
Fixed and verified.  Change to sec_attr_trig_query, which required 
some rewrite, verified by bart_f and ahop.  Changes to other manpages 
verified by me.

automated backup devices).

many of the .zA/.zZ macro labels, and most of the comment headers

The dcecp specification (RFC42.3) list of changes (Section 1.1) lists the
following item which is not contained in the OSF DCE Command Reference:

[1/19/96 public]

This was fixed in the November dcecp drop from HP, which I incorporated
(the relevant passage is marked with .zA/.zZ and the CR number in the
clock.8dce manpage).

The dcecp specification (RFC42.3) list of changes (Section 1.1) lists the
following item which is not contained in the OSF DCE Command Reference:

       (dr) `endpoint show' and `delete' take an optional argument of a
            single string binding to identify an endpoint map to contact.

At one time, (some/all) endpoint operations did not work for remote ep
maps. Are they working now?

[1/19/96 public]

The optional arguments mentioned above were added in the November
drop of dcecp manpages from HP, which I incorporated into the tree
here. The relevant passage in endpoint.8dce is marked with .zA/.zZ
and the CR number.

       (cu) Changed the format of ERA's of encoding type `void'.

[1/19/96 public]

As far as I could tell, this was not fixed in the November dcecp
manpage drop from HP. I am reassigning responsibility to Pam
Millett, who is about to do some further work on various manpages
for 1.2.1.

[1/19/96 public]

The meager description of encoding type void in the current manpages
pretty much matches the rest of the encoding type descriptions
The changes to the 'void' encoding type were at a lower level than
then manpage is describing.

Of course, we could argue that the manpage should cover all encoding
types in more detail, but that is for another OT.

following item which is not contained in the OSF DCE Command Reference:

       (cp) Updated output of CDS commands.  The `cdscache show' command
            output has been changed, also the following attributes of
            `directory' and `clearinghouse show' commands have changed:

                  Clearinghouse_uuid     CH_UUID
                  Clearinghouse_name     CH_Name
                  dir_uuid               Dir_UUID
                  directory              Dir_Name

  Just the directory.8dce refpage needs to be updated with:
     Clearinghouse_uuid     CH_UUID
     Clearinghouse_name     CH_Name

This was fixed in the November dcecp manpage drop from HP, which

            though the value of the `CDS_LinkTarget' attribute is.  Also
            the format of the `CDS_LinkTimeout' attribute has been
            specified, both as an attribute list, and as a short format for
            the `-timeout' option.

      (Also, the "-linkto" option is listed in the doc as "-to".)

[1/19/96 public]

As far as I could tell, there was no fix for this in the November
dcecp manpage drop from HP. I am reassigning responsibility to
Pam Millett, who is about to do some further work on the manpages
at HP.

[1/19/96 public]

The -linkto / -to stuff was resolved (it's '-to').  The manpage has
pretty good descriptions of the CDS_LinkTarget and CDS_LinkTimeout
attributes.  There is also a good 'create' example.

dce_cf.h needs to include <stdio.h> for FILE's definition.

[08/11/95 public]
No.  Your program should include stdio.h before include dce_cf.h.
We try to avoid nesting headerfiles, and certainly DONT want to
include system files in DCE files.

[8/12/95 public]

This is about as close to a zealot as I get:

1) There is at least a doc bug because nowhere is it mentioned that it is
necessary to include <stdio.h> when including <dce_cf.h>. I was simply
using dce_cf_get_host_name and dce_cf_prin_name_from_host, neither of which
require *anything* from <stdio.h>.

2) Aside from this, at a time when the world is getting reasonable ;) (e.g.
a cursory look at XPG4.2 aka spec 1170 did not turn up a *single* api
requiring inclusion of more than a single header file --including the
network apis) so should we. As a programmer using an api I simply want to
include the relevant header (which, in a sense, "exports" the functional
*abstraction*), period. If that header has additional dependencies it
should take care of them. Yes, I've heard all about compilation efficiency
issues (e.g. regarding multiple inclusion of the same header) but I'm not
convinced: as far as I'm concerned that is an implementation issue and a
well written cpp could take care of that problem.

That's all.

[08/12/95 public]
It's a doc bug.  Suppose we did what you suggested.  Since all header files
must be protected against multiple inclusion, the following will work:
	#include <dce_cf.h>
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <pthread.h>
But the user won't get the wrappe code.

Or should dce_cf.h include pthread.h, too?  (Rhetorical question.)

[02/06/96 public]
Changed to doc category as was Rich saying...

Some further explanation courtesy of rps:
It is not possible to have arbitrary UUIDs. 
(krbtgt/... names do not have 
embedded UNIX IDs, but these are "internal use only".)  However, it is 
possible to assign UUIDs as long as the embedded uid matches 
the .uid struct

[7/10/95 public]

The man page for sec_rgy_pgo_add gives a mixed message about whether
a user can supply his own UUID.  The first two bullet items in the
description seem to say you can.  But what are we to make of the 
sentence "If the registry uses embedded UNIX IDs..."?  Doesn't the
registry always use embedded UNIX IDs?  

rs_pgo_add() almost always calls rsdb_unix_uuid_gen_check() with the 
embedded_unix_id flag set.  I don't see how the user can ever 
around this.  Even if he sets the UNIX number to -1, per documentation,
he still gets back a sec_rgy_uuid_bad_version error.

I suggest that documentation be enhanced to describe how the user
can supply his own UUID, or simply say that he can't, and that the
UUID field in the pgo_item record must be NULL.

Charlie Rusman at Hitachi noted that several rpc subcommands
(e.g. rpcentry) are documented as supporting the -version
option, but there is no functionality in the API.  

John Rousseau summarized as follows:

rpc* export does not (and should not) take a -version
option. 

rpcentry unexport does take a -version option, and handles
it correctly. 

It seems that rpc* import is the only routine that is in
error. 

The CR's should state that rpc{entry,group,profile}
import should not take a -version option. The documentation
should reflect this change.

[2/2/96 public]

This is the doc part of ot12911, which was fixed in 1.2.1.
The dcecp manpages were updated to reflect the removal of
the -version option.

The man page for cdsd doesn't mention the -v option, which was
introduced to allow setting the default directory version for
new clearinghouses, e.g.:

	cdsd -v 4.0 

There should also be some mention of the implications of using
this switch, i.e., the assumption that existing clearinghouses
have already been created at or upgraded to the specified version 
number.

 In the manpage sec_rgy_pgo_unix_num_to_name(3sec), a commented

 The mkwhatis script, that generates the whatis database, cannot
 handle this. The result is garbage in the whatis database.

There is apparently some confusion/error in the dce_msg_XXX manpages.
They way in which some routines return strings is wrong or misleading.
Here's the definitive descriptions:
	dce_msg_get -- pointer to malloc'd memory
	dce_msg_get_default_msg -- pointer to static space (an entry
		in an in-core message table) or NULL on error
	dce_msg_get_msg -- pointer to malloc'd memory or NULL on error
		(code bug -- it doesn't use dce_strdup)
	dce_msg_get_cat_msg -- returns a pointer same "style" as catgets:
		undefined if static or malloc'd (don't free it).  Valid
		only until next call to any of the routines described here
		or dce_error_inq_text.
	dce_msg_cat_get_msg -- Same as above, except ignore the "Valid only"
		part.

The doc needs to be reviewed to ensure that it matches the above.

[08/21/96 public]
I don't have any more info to add, let me try to reword the above.  The
manpages for many of the dce_msg routines share some common errors:  when
is the returned data allocated (via malloc), and when is it a pointer to
static data?  It is important to know this, so that user-code knows when
to call free() and when not to call free().

Here is the table of what the routines return:
    dce_msg_get -- malloc'd data
    dce_msg_get_default_msg -- private pointer or NULL on error; don't call free
    dce_msg_get_msg -- malloc'd data or NULL on error
    dce_msg_get_cat_msg -- The returned data should not be free'd.  Instead,
	the output pointer is valid (useable) until the next call to any
	other dce_msg routine or dce_error_inq_text is called.
    dce_msg_cat_get_msg -- The returned data should not be free'd.  Instead,
	the output pointer is valid (useable) until the next call to
	dce_msg_cat_get_msg, or dce_msg_cat_close is called.

At least dceacl_is_client_authorized is wrong.  Maybe some others.
The DCE ACL library supports the concepts of objects having owners
and being in a group (e.g., files).  The documentation is missing
the "owner" and "group" uuid's.  I haven't looked at the other docs,
but I am worried that an entire last update (the owner/group stuff
was added to the library later) might have gotten lost.

Firstly, the server(8dce) man page, in the ATTRIBUTES section under "services",
says 

            bindings protocol_sequence_list
                      A list of string bindings identifying the service.
                      This is only specified for well-known endpoints.

However, the restriction that it is only specified for well-known endpoints
is not enforced.  Examples in the "server create" subpage list bindings without
endpoints, and there is no way I know of for dced to check the IDL definition
of an interface for well-known endpoints.  I think that the sentence
"This is only specified for well-known endpoints." should be removed.

Secondly, under the subpage "server stop" of the server(8dce) man page, the
reader should be warned that if there is more than one instance of a server
using a given interface, object UUID and a given binding without endpoints, then
the "rpc" method of stopping the server will stop a randomly-selected instance
of the server -- NOT NECESSARILY THE INSTANCE SPECIFIED IN THE COMMAND.  This is
due to the inability of the RPC runtime to distinguish server instances on any
criteria other than interface and object or endpoint, and the fact that the RPC
specification allows multiple server instances to share the same interface and
object UUID.  This problem does not exist with the other methods of stopping a
server, which will stop only the instance specified in the command.  If the
"rpc" method must be used, then this problem can be avoided by starting only one
server instance for any server config object, and assigning a unique object UUID
for each server config object.

[2/2/96 public]

   This information was included in the 'server stop' section of
   the server man page and is in the November drop.

Following is a prime example of incomplete and inaccurate reference pages
provided in DCE documentation. The man page sec_rgy_acct_add(3sec) covers
only 20% of the information needed to write a sensible application code. This
is just one of many security man pages that are described to the level that
makes writing a good security application next to impossible.

Attached here is sample questions from one of our customers who is trying to
write some DCE application. I am opening a general defect against Security
man pages that should be fixed to cover more details and be less cryptic
about its behavior and usage.

------------------------------QUESTIONS-----------------------------------
I really do need help on the following call. Some illustrative code segment 
would be great.

The call that I need help is on

void sec_rgy_acct_add(
	sec_rgy_handle_t context,
	sec_rgy_login_name_t *login_name,
	sec_rgy_acct_key_t *key_parts,
	sec_rgy_acct_user_t *user_part,
	sec_rgy_acct_admin_t *admin_part,
	sec_passwd_rec_t *caller_key,
	sec_passwd_rec_t *new_key,
	sec_passwd_type_t new_keytype,
	sec_passwd_version_t *new_key_version,
	error_status_t *status);

Things I understand:
--------------------
1.  The pgo must be completely specified. If the principal that is being added
    is not member of the g and o specified in login name. Then 
    sec_rgy_pgo_add_member must be used to set the membership so that the 
    principal being added is member of the group and the org.


THINGS I DONT UNDERSTAND:
-------------------------------
What should be the value of new_keytype ?

Do the user part and the admin_part of the input arguments have to completely
specified ? 

Are there any fields in user_part and admin_part that can be left blank so 
that they will be filled in with default values by secd ?

I dont quite know how to fill out caller key and new_key fields.

The only reported here is the missing information for the sec_rgy_acct_add()

information.  If there are other manpages that you know of that have problems,
then please open a defect describing those problems.

have already been submitted.  Just being thorough.

An overview of the effects of delegation with respect to ACLs on DCE LFS
objects needs to be incorporated into the DFS documentation.  I'm hoping for
just a couple of pages of text and a high-level summary in a single section.
Added field Transarc Deltas with value `' 
Added field Transarc Herder with value `' 
Added field Transarc Status with value `'

[10/19/94 public]
All information on delegation for DCE LFS objects and DFS in general has been
incorporated into a new section in the aclgroup.gpsml file.  I added the text
to this chapter because the lion's share of the impact applies directly to ACLs
on DCE LFS objects.  The new section is four pages long.
 
Ron Arbo reviewed the text for me (twice!).  I included all of his technical
comments and many of his additional, helpful comments.  Reviewers here have
also looked over the text.  I believe this one can be closed (but I reserve
the right to make additional tweaks by 6:00 p.m. tomorrow evening...;-).

in any way during any part of the build. It can be installed manually
under ODE, and the separate programs are built with generic Makefiles.

[10/13/94 public]

Currently doc/dce_books/app_ref/man3dce/dce_printf.3dce documents both the
dce_printf and dce_pgm_printf suites of interfaces.  There is a
dce_pgm_printf.3dce page which simply contains

.so man3dce/dce_printf.3dce

This strucutre causes a number of problems, including double inclusion of a
man page in the book and errors in the installref process.  While there are
ways to use a single reference page for multiple interfaces that require
multiple access points, instituting them at this time would cause too many
perturbations in the engame process.  Therefore, we need to take the
dce_pgm_*printf (and relevant common) documentation and put it directly
into the dce_pgm_printf.3dce page in place of the .so.  This should be done
for 1.1.  (Of course rsvh of the pages will still document three
interfaces, but that is the UNIX way, and probably the right way too.)

[10/18/94 public]
Fixed and verified.  Moved the relevant text from dce_printf.3dce
to the reference page dce_pgm_printf.3dce.  The offending .so call
is no more.

[1/18/94 public]
Why was dce_pgm_printf.3dce doing ".so man3dce/dce_printf.3dce"?
Shouldn't it have been doing the games with the "dce.links" file
(in the DTE), like OSF1's print?  That file (optionally) directs the
manpage install prog to create the file with ".so man3dce/dce_printf.3dce"
as the contents.  (Unless I'm missing something here...)

You should not run the following tests on more than one machine (on the
same local network) at the same time:

	gds_sec
	switch_mt
	switch_st
	switch_DNS

This is because each of these tests has a standard cellname hard-coded into
the test.  If you run the same test on more than one local machine at once,
the cells will catch the other cells broadcasts (thinking it is it's own),
and strange things will begin to happen.

This needs to be documented in the GDS chapter of the Porting and Testing
Guide.

The following cross-component documentation for hierarchical
cells and cell aliasing needs to be created:

The Administration Guide - Introduction, Chapter 3, "Global
and Cell Considerations" needs to be modified to describe
the guidelines for creating a hierarchical cell and for
changing a cell's name.

The Administration Guide - Core Components book needs
to describe how to create a child cell from scratch,
how to make an existing cell a child cell, and the
implications of (and how to go about) changing
a cell name when it is a child in a hierarchy.
(Not sure in which part this info belongs yet.)

The Introduction to DCE needs to add introductory
information about cell aliasing and hierarchical
cells. This work has already been completed
under CR 11783 (the CR to update the Intro to
DCE with new 1.1 technology).

Assigning this CR to myself (I'm the OSF cross-component
hcells/cell alias doc owner).

Input is now needed for the R1.1 relnotes.
For each component, these release notes will tell:

	a) What is in R1.1

	b) What has changed since R1.0.3

Note: DFS will be fully included in these relnotes.

Component owners can get this information to me in two ways:

	a) Get yourself a copy of the current (beta-based) relnotes in

/project/dce/build/dcedoc-latest/release_doc/relnotes/Output/draft/ps

	   and give me a marked up revision (or e-mail if you prefer).

	b) Send notes as you think of them to me at dce-relnotes.

You may do b).  You must do a).

Among the information I need is the following.  This list might be
incomplete, with the wrong people cited; so component owners should
correct me.

[9/22/94 public]
When reviewing the audit, man pages I discovered that many of the
status return codes as currently documented are incorrect.  A full
review needs to be done and the pages need to be updated.

[10/21/94 public]
All the Audit API man pages have been updated to reflect the correct
status codes for these APIs.

The audit-admin group has been added for DCE 1.1 to allow
for easier management of the auditd.  It allows the auditd
to be managed by remote nodes.

audit-admin needs to be described in various appropriate 
places, such as 

The Admin Guide Intro chapter on "Global and Cell Considerations" 
(admin_gd/overview/overview/3_cell.gpsml)

The Admin Guide Intro chapter on "Overview of DCE Maintenance"
(admin_gd/overview/overview/9_tasks.gpsml)

The Admin Guide Intro Namespace appendix
(admin_gd/overview/overview/appa.gpsml)

The auditd reference page
(command_ref/man8sec/auditd.8sec)

[09/30/94 public]
Reassigned to writer Lisa Zahn.

[10/12/94 public]

The chapters in the Admin Guide on "Global and Cell
Considerations" and "Overview of DCE Maintenance"
do not need to be modified to include audit-admin
information, because they do not talk about other
related groups.

The Intro to DCE, Chapter 3 does need to be modified
to talk about the ability to remotely administer
auditds (in the section entitled "Security Service
Administration"). I added the fix.

And the Admin Guide chapter "Overview of DCE Maintenance"
does need to be mofieid to talk generally about Audit Service
maintenance, but that's CR10234.

Modified the Admin Guide - Intro Namespace appendix 
(Appendix A) text and figure (figure modification
courtesy of P. Neilson) to show new audit-admin group
and explain its default ACLs, etc.

Modified the auditd.8sec reference page for audit-admin.

Changed this CR to "fix". Will distribute to Jerry Kazin for
technical verification.

Here's what's left to do to complete the DCE1.1 dcecp reference pages.

WHAT'S GOT TO BE DONE:
**********************
All of the objects are generally done (in the tree) but many have:
- new or deleted options
- new or deleted attributes 
- changed limitations on options or arguments (number of, required vs
  optional, etc)
The current list of changes is included later (they're all spec'ed in
RFC42.3)


WHAT MIGHT NOT GET DONE:
************************
The 'Permissions Required' sections are uneven. Although most have the
information they need, it's presented inconsistently. That is, some
say "You must have d permission..." others say "You must have delete
permission..." and still others say "You must have (d)elete
permission...". Maybe this is a prentice hall edit.

Unfortunately, there may not be time to provide examples beyond those
already included in the 'EXAMPLES' sections of the ref pages. Further,
those that are already included need to be verified. 

Lots of the text in the reference pages is in passive voice. There is
not enough time in the schedule to convert this to active voice. 


THE LIST OF DCECP OBJECT REF PAGE CHANGES:
******************************************
The following list of dcecp changes was taken from section 1.1 of:

   457385 Sep  8 13:17 /users/melman/dsh/doc/rfc42.3.txt

Generally these items identify changes that must be incorporated into
the dcecp object reference pages.   My comments are flush left. 
**************************


       (bm) Added `registry verify'.

       (bn) Added `-randompwd' option to `account modify'.

See item (dc) which removes the `-ramdompwd' option.

       (bo) Removed ERA's from the `registry' object.

       (bp) Changed `-c' option to `dcecp' to take one value instead of the
            rest of the arguments.  This is so adding more options to
            `dcecp' will not force them to be position dependent.

       (bq) Added the `-certify' option to `login'.

       (br) Specified the order of the output of `registry show'.

       (bs) Specified `-noupdate' on the appropriate RPC commands

       (bt) Changed the default value of the `courierrole' attribute from
            `noncourier' to `backup'.

       (bu) Secified the `user', `host', and `cell' task scripts.

Although these reference pages have bben created, there are questions
about what's implemented for host configure and host unconfigure
operations.

       (bv) Specified the `-s' option to the `dcecp' program.

       (bw) Added the global variable `dcecp_verbose_errors' which causes
            `dcecp' to output the entire contents of `errorInfo' to
            `stderr' in the event of an error.

Possibly mentioned in the dcecp reference page.

       (bx) Renamed the `schema' object `xattrschema' to match the name of
            the namespace objects and the ACL manager.

Done.

       (by) Added the following commands:

Done ->           dts catalog
                  clock compare
                  clearinghouse catalog 
See item (di) and (dj)

       (bz) Added `name get'.

       (ca) Added the `scope' attribute to `xattrschema'.

       (cb) Corrected argument handling of `registry catalog'.

       (cc) Renamed `cellalias' to `cdsalias'.
Done.
       (cd) Changed `cdsalias set -child' to `cdsalias connect'.

       (ce) Specified the output of `cdscache show'.

       (cf) Added `cellalias' object for big hierachical cells script.
Done.

       (cg) Addded the following commands:

                  clearinghouse checkpoint
                  clearinghouse repair
                  clearinghouse verify

       (ch) Added that the `applydefs', `intercell', `scope', and `unique'
            attributes on the `xattrschema' object are only advisory in DCE
            1.1.

       (ci) Changed the default value of the `tolerance' attribute of the
            `dts' object to 5 minutes as per DCE CR 11089.

       (cj) The `user' commands take a list of user names as an argument.

       (ck) Fixed typo in `object show -schema' description.

       (cl) Added that the user must be `root' to run `cdscache dump'.

       (cm) Clarified the descriptions of the `goodsince' and `server'
            attributes of the `account' object.

       (cn) Changed the description of the `CDS_ObjectUUID' attribute in
            the `directory' and `clearinghouse' objects.

       (co) Clarified descriptions of all the attributes of the `directory'
            object, particularly the `CDS_INCHName', `CDS_UpgradeTo', and
            `CDS_RingPointer' attributes.

       (cp) Updated output of CDS commands.  The `cdscache show' command
            output has been changed, also the following attributes of
            `directory' and `clearinghouse show' commands have changed:

                  Clearinghouse_uuid     CH_UUID
                  Clearinghouse_name     CH_Name
                  dir_uuid               Dir_UUID
                  directory              Dir_Name

       (cq) Added `-local' to all `keytab' commands.

       (cr) Typo in `masteruuid' attribute of `registry', the value is of
            type UUID, not integer.

       (cs) Modified description of `clock set' so that `-to' is optional.

       (ct) The `rpcgroup add' command now allows the user to enter
            duplicates entries and does _not_ flag an error.

       (cu) Changed the format of ERA's of encoding type `void'.

       (cv) Added the `registry connect' command.

       (cw) There is a new optional argument `registry catalog' to specify
            a single name of a cell or a string binding.

       (cx) Specified the syntax of multiple routing and debug routing
            specifiers.

       (cy) Added the `_h' convenience variable.

Add descriptions of the convenience variables _b, _c, _h, and _u to
the dcecp reference page. (see item dd)

       (cz) Added the `registry set' command.

       (da) Specified that `import' only reports an error if no match was
            found in _any_ of the names specified in the argument list.

I believe 'import' applies to rpcentry, rpcgroup, and rpcprofile objects.

       (db) Renamed `name' in the `service' attribute to be `entryname'.

Not sure what refpage this is in...

       (dc) Removed the `-randompwd' option from the `account modify'
            command and added the `account generate' command.  This is to
            avoid the case where a password can be changed in the registry
            but the server crashes before the user is informed of the new
            password.

       (dd) Added the `_b(sec)' convenience variable to replace portions of
            `_s(sec)'.  This way `_s' is only set by the user not by
            `dcecp', and `_b' is only set by `dcecp' and not by the user.
            Much less confusion can reign.

       (de) Added the `operations' attribute to the `server' object.  It is
            only available for input, it is not output.

       (df) Specified that the argument to `registry show -master' can be a
            cellname.

       (dg) Added the `-noprivacy' option to all `keytab' commands.

       (dh) Added a new section on _Warning Messages_.

This information goes in the dcecp reference page.

       (di) `clearinghouse checkpoint' is now `clearinghouse initiate'.

       (dj) Cleaned up the new `clearinghouse' commands, particularly
            `verify'.

       (dk) Added `secval status'.
A very simple addition.

       (dl) The `acl show' command describes the causes of UUID's being
            displayed instead of names more completely.

       (dm) Added a `-xattrs' option to `principal', `group',
            `organization' and `registry show' operations.  Some also get a
            `-all'.

       (dn) Added `SAMEAS' routing specifier.

Applies to the `log' ref page.

       (do) Added the `-uuid' option to `endpoint show'.


****** END OF CURRENT CHANGES TO RFC42.3 ******
You need to check with later versions of the spec to see if more
changes occur.

[9/7/94 public]
The Porting & Testing Guide should discuss dce_cma_error_inq_text().
Some things to say:

dce_cma_error_inq_text() is a non-threaded version of dce_error_inq_text(). 
It returns a thread message, given a status. (same as dce_error_inq_text)
It is hard-wired to look for technology=dce and component=threads and reject
with error if it's not.  When porting threads, one could get rid of
dce_cma_error_inq_text() (make it a macro to do nothing or delete the calls,
which are in very few places in threads code) and threads would still work
fine; you'd have to find your own way to report the errors then. (Ask rsalz
if you need to know more.)

This has been written up and inserted into Chapter 4 (Threads) of the Porting

[8/31/94 public]

There is a new (very simple) secval API and associated dcecp command.
The API is dced_secval_status().  It sets an boolean32 out parameter to 
TRUE or FALSE depending on whether the dced secval service is activated
or deactivated via the dced_secval_start() and dced_secval_stop() commands.

The dcecp secval status command returns a "1" or "0" (in the same manner
as the secval ping command).

[9/2/94 public]
Created the new ref. page for dced_secval_status() routine.
This routine is actually a part of the new dced funcionality which is
completely covered in CR 9830.

[09/06/94 public]
Retrospectively assigned this CR to writer John Shirley
(dced doc owner).

The Sec Salvager is being moved to nosupport, and the documentation for it
should be removed from the Admin docs.  Pam will send me the material that
she removes from the docs, and I will hand it to the RATs for inclusion in
the nosupport tree along with the code.

We also need to determine if any changes to dce_config as part of this work
require changes to the dce_config documentation in the Admin Guide Intro
volume.

[8/30/94 public]
sec_salvage_db descripitions removed from sec admin_gd and sec_salvage_db.8sec 
manpage defuncted.  


I 've left this bug open because of Hal's note about dce_config. 

Hal, my part of this is done, please close it or assign it to the 
dce_config writer.

[8/31/94 public]
The documentation is now in nosupport/security/sec_salvage_db/doc/
Reassigned to Admin Gd V1 doc owner, who should determine if there are any
required changes to dce_config docs in Admin Guide intro volume.

[9/9/94 public]

Well, the salvager is being moved to unintegrated because it is needed for 
migration from 1.0.3 to 1.1.  The following reflects the believe current
doc status and a process for updating the required information:

We have already moved the salvager reference and guide documentation from
the doc tree into nosupport.  We will move the reference page back to the
Command Reference.  We will not be reinstating the guide documentation both
because of the work involved just to reinstate it and because the salvager
is now effective only as a transition tool, which would require a thorough
review and probable rewriting of this material.  However, I would like to
know whether we should simply nuke the guide material or leave it in
nosupport.  My belief is that nuking it is the correct thing to do, but
would appreciate input before we do so.

Now for the requests: Any changes to the reference page should be done by
providing specific change information in CR 11918.  The necessary
information about using the salvager as a migration tool will go in the
release notes.  The information should be put in CR 11918, but should
also be mailed to dce-relnotes@osf.org.  One acceptable mechanism is to
add dce-relnotes to the Interest List CC field of the CR when you do
provide the transition information.

Note:  I will be responsible for moving the reference page back into the
Command reference and will assign any updates to the page when they are
recieved.  Susan is still responsible for any required changes to the
Admin Gd Vol 1 (which will NOT include any migration information).  The
release notes writer is responsible for inserting the migration information
in the notes.

[10/11/94 public]
Checked the DCE configuration material for references to the Security
Salvager or output showing the tool's name.  Neither exist.

[10/27/94 public]
Confirmed with Rajendra Desai that the Sec Salvager is not used for DCE
configuration or reconfiguration.  As noted the utility was discussed in
Chapter 28 "Troubleshooting Procedures" of the Admin. Guide-Core Volume.
The material in that document has been deleted.

We need a manpage for the "svcdumplog" program.
It will be a short one, something like:

NAME
    svcdumplog - Print a binary serviceability log file
SYNOPSYS
    svcdumplog [-s N] logfile
DESCRIPTION
    The \*Ldcesvcdumplog\*O program will print the contents of a binary
    log file...
    The '-s' flag tells the thing to skip the first N log entries before
    printing.

    dce_svc_log(3dce), svcroute(5dce) [whatever], others...

[8/25/94 public]
Wait a minute.  I talked with Howard, and we may put this functionality into
dcecp, so there's a good chance that it may go there.  A manpage should
still be written, and will be nearly the same whether it's a separate
program, or a dcecp cmd (Desription on down will be the same).
The CR for the coding part is 11871.

[10/26/94 public]
This was not made a part of dcecp, so the manpage was written as originally
proposed. Reviewed by John Bowe.

util_signal needs to be thread safe:
 * It should include the DCE Threads wrappers
 * HAVE_SIGACTION should be #defined for it's compilation
   In fact we might just want to assume we have it (DCE coding style guide)
   and remove all the code that assumes we don't (the #else's)
 * There needs to be locking around the global variable numInterps
   Not sure about: signalsReceived and signalTrapCmds

Also the function declarations should all be ANSI style and not old style.
The internal prototypes should be ANSI prototypes and not need _ANSI_ARGS()

[8/22/94 public]
All the above have been done except putting the locking around the global
variables. In light of other thread-safety problems currently in dcecp,
this is not important. Changed to a doc bug to be mentioned in the
porting guide.

	dcecp's "user create" command creates a user and creates a CDS
directory for the user. It then sets the acl for the directory. Supposedly,
the user should now be able to create entries under this directory.

	The problem is, the user will be able to create objects under the
directory, but not directories, since he needs write permission to the
clearinghouse to be able to create directories.

	It is not as simple as adding an acl to grant user xxx the permision
to the clearinghouse. Imagine hundreds of users in a cell, you should not have
the acl for the clearinghouse to list all the users. It has to be group.

[8/8/94 public]
I've changed this to a doc bug.  Ward please include something to the
following effect in the section on customizing (or maybe using) the user
create command.

As we ship DCE 1.1 the user create command will set the ACL on the
/.:/users/<username> directory so that users can insert things.  This alone
lets them insert objects and links.  To insert directories (a much more
expensive proposition) you also need write access to the clearinghouse that
will hold the directory.  The user create script does NOT change this
because: 

 * We don't know what the name of the clearinghouse is, though it could
   default to the clearinghouse holding /.:/users/<username>
 * If every user is going to have write access to the clearinghouse, why
   not just put {any_other rw-t-} on the clearinghouse.  FYI the default
   is: 
	dcecp> acl show /.:/absolut_ch
	{unauthenticated r--t-}
	{group subsys/dce/cds-admin rwdtc}
	{group subsys/dce/cds-server rwdtc}
	{any_other r--t-}
 * Directories are expensive and perhaps the admin does not want users
   creating them.

Any of the above could be changed by admin policy and the user create
script modified to allow for that policy.  The section on customizing
should mention this.  The section on *using* this command should have a big
bold note describing that in the *default* config users will not be able to
add directories.

[08/09/94 public]
Assigned this bug to Ward Rosenberry.
Please also make any corresponding changes to the user.8dce ref page
in the Command Reference.

[10/05/94 public]
Added necessary information to the 'user create' and 'extending scripts'
sections of the 'User' task object chapter in the admin gd. I'll set this
CR to verified after the final review approves the new material.

The porting guide and data files for the gds system tests need more explicit 
information on node name setup for the tests.

For dcegdshd, the data file sTest.gds should state that the shell variables
mach_1 - mach_n should be used to define the machines to be used in the test.
Hard-coding node names in the variable ALL_MACH will cause the test setup 
to fail.

For gdx_xds_str_001, for the initial test configuration, shell variables
mach_1 - mach_n should be defined, and the shell variable CLI_MACHINES should 
have hard-coded node names, or use the $mach_1 - $mach_n.

The svcroute.5 manpage should discuss environment variables for setting
routes, including debugging.  This is not spelled out clearly in any manpage.

svcroute should describe setting routes by all mechanisms: routes file,
env variables, and command line options.  It should be made clear that
the syntax is the same.

IDL generated code dce/utils/svc/svcbin_cstub.c
contains the following TRY-ENDTRY block:

TRY
IDL_param_vec[1] = (rpc_void_p_t)&h;
IDL_param_vec[2] = (rpc_void_p_t)data;

According to the threads documentation the behaviour is undefined
if you use CATCH and FINALLY in the same TRY-ENDTRY block.

[7/12/94 public]
Rico, any thoughts on this?

[7/13/94 public]
It is documented in this manner for flexiblity in implementation
on differing systems.  The macro-based implementation works
fine with TRY/CATCH/FINALLY (we specifically asked the DCEthreads
people).  Without that optimization the stubs would require
2 TRY blocks instead of one.  We want to avoid the performance hit
of doing that if at all possible.

If IDL is ever ported to a platfrom that doesn't support
TRY/CATCH/FINALLY then the sysdep.h macro NO_TRY_CATCH_FINALLY must
be defined as 1 for that platform.

[7/13/94 public]
Thanks for the info Rico, I would say this needs to be
documented in the Porting Guide under the idl porting section.
Making this a doc bug.

I have replaced the configuration script 'dce.clean' with
a new script, dce_shutdown.  This is based on the old
dce.clean with the following changes:

 - dce_shutdown has a much better name

 - dce_shutdown uses the control programs (aka dcecp) to shutdown
   dtsd, auditd, cdsadv, cdsd, and secd.  It will continue
   to use kill on other daemons.  It will also use kill if
   a shutdown command doesn't work.

 - dce_shutdown has an option (-f) which will force the old
   behavior of dce.clean, which is to use the kill command
   to terminate all DCE daemons.

 - dce_shutdown enforces the fact that you should be root to run it.

/etc/dce.clean is installed as a symbolic link to dce_shutdown
for compatability, however all DCE configuration scripts use dce_shutdown.

[7/25/94 public]

During Rich Salz's "Towers" presentation to the DCE home team a few
weeks ago, he mentioned he is planning to add dce_shutdown-type
functionality to dced. So it's possible that dced will "obsolete"
dce_shutdown...if the dced functionality gets implemented by 1.1.

Assigned this CR to Susan Teto (OSF DCE configuration writer).

[10/24/94 public]
Replaced the description of dce.clean with one for dce_shutdown.  Also,
added descriptions of the DIR_REPLICATE, PWD_MGMT_SVR,
PWD_MGMT_SVR_OPTIONS, and TIME_SERVER environment variables for dce_config
and the CONFIG_NFS_GATEWAY environemnt variable for dfs_config.  Verified

The Glossary in the "Introduction to DCE" does not document PCS or
Portable Character Set.  It should include a definition.

[8/15/94 public]

Added the following definition for PCS to the glossary:

DCE Portable Character Set (PCS) - the group of characters
for which DCE guarantees support. The DCE RPC runtime requires
that all DCE RPC clients and servers support the DCE PCS.
The IDL base type specifiers char and idl_char identify
DCE PCS characters.

Also added the following i18n-related terms:

character set - a group of characters, such as the English
alphabet, Japanese Kanji, and the European set of characters.

code set - a mapping of the members of a character set to specific
numeric code values. Examples include ASCII, JIS X0208, and ISO 8859-1.

international character - a character that is not a member of
the DCE PCS character set and so is not guaranteed to be
supported in the DCE environment. Programmers writing
RPC applications that use international characters build
support for them into their applications using user-provided
or DCE RPC-provided features for international character support.

code set registry - a per-host file that contains, for each
code set supported on the host, a mapping between the string
name for the code set (which is the name used on the
host to refer to the code set ) and a unique identifier that
has been assigned (by OSF or by the site) to the code set.

I will ask Mariko Romagna to verify these definitions.

[9/6/94 public]

Mariko verified and made some corrections to the terms
shown above. I emailed revised versions to Willie Williams
(OSF glossary owner). Reassigned the CR to Willie so that
he can fill in the "affected files" field and mark it
verified.

According to spec and man page, dcecp should accept multiple commands

rename              Rename the specified principal.

help                Print summary of command-line options and abort.

help                Print summary of command-line options and abort.
operations          Return valid operations for command.

[6/6/94 public]
Well, not exactly. When Tcl evaluates a procedure or a multi-command
line, the 'result' (what the command returns to the user for output)
is whatever the last command output. Each of the commands is being
executed, but only the output of the last command is being output.

> dcecp -c "login cell_admin -p dcecp; dts modify -minservers 3; logout"

This command would not work if the login didn't happen.

There is another bug that I found in verifying this. There is a 
bad variable scoping problem. 

> dcecp -c "set x 4; set y 5; set x"
4
> dcecp -c "set x 4; set y 5; set x; set y"
5
> dcecp -c "set x 4; set y 5; set x; set y; expr ($x + $y)"
x: Undefined variable.

I'm going to keep this open until we have a handle on all the
issues here.

[kevins 6/6/94 public] 
Well, not exactly. In this example:
 
> dcecp -c "set x 4; set y 5; set x; set y; expr ($x + $y)"
x: Undefined variable.

The shell is attempting to evaluate the $x and $y. Single quotes will
prevent this from occurring. For instance:

> dcecp -c 'set x 4; set y 5; set x; set y; expr ($x + $y)'
9

produces the correct result. 

However in the previous problem originally reported by Martha:

> dcecp -c "dir help;prin help;log help"

This particular problem can be overcome by:

> dcecp -c "puts [dir help]; puts [prin help]; puts [log help]"

Ugly but it works. At least it doesn't give you a "syntax error"

[6/6/94 public]
Cancelled.  The output problem is a standard Tcl misconception that
we'll have to fix with documentation.  Commands don't write to stdout,
they store their value in result.  When you use ;'s on a command line
the last command wins.

The scoping problem seems to be understood.

[6/13/94 public]
Re-opened and changed to doc so we make sure it gets fixed in the documenation.

[6/13/94 public]
Ward, I'll be sure to give you comments on this in my review.

[10/26/94 public]

We partially fixed this problem by adding the following information to
Section 1.3.2 "Invoking dcecp Operations" in the Administration Guide core
volume:

Be careful entering multiple operations using the \*Ldcecp\*O command
with the \*L-c\*O option because operation results return to the
\*Ldcecp\*O interpreter, not to the shell.  An operation like the
following returns the results of just the last operation (\*Lgroup list
users\*O) to the shell.
.oS
% \*Ldcecp -c "group list staff; group list managers; group list users"\*C
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/P_Pestana
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/R_Parsons
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/L_Jones

/.../ward_cell.osf.org/D_Witt
/.../ward_cell.osf.org/C_Pilat
 .
 .
 .

.oE

This needs the additional work of adding the following workaround to the
text:

"This particular problem can be overcome by:

> dcecp -c "puts [dir help]; puts [prin help]; puts [log help]"

Ugly but it works. At least it doesn't give you a "syntax error"

This CR work is being deferred until DCE 1.2.

[2/9/96 public]

We'll re-open this one for the couple lines that sill need
to go into the Admin Guide.  For the record, they are

   "This particular problem can be overcome by:"

   > dcecp -c "puts [dir help]; puts [prin help]; puts [log help]"

To avoid OT clutter, this bug will serve for both the Admin Guide
and the manpages.  millett@apollo.hp.com will make the required
manpage changes and put a note here when that part is done.

so will be in the OSF tree soon.  Margaret still needs to

We should document in either the porting guide or the release notes that
when you compile DCE on a 486 running OSF/1 version xxx and using strict
compiler warnings you can see lots of warnings like this:
    /usr/include/i386/endian.h:99: warning: no previous prototype for `ntohs'
    /usr/include/i386/endian.h:108: warning: no previous prototype for `ntohl'
They are a nuisance, but benign; they're an OSF/1 header file bug.
It will happen any time code needs a system header file that decides IT
needs endian.h (e.g., if you need sys/param.h or sys/types.h you can get
it).

[6/8/94 public]

I gave a cursory look at both the release notes and the porting guide,
and it seems like the information either belongs in the Build Environment
chapter in the Porting Guide, or in the chapter in the release notes that
talks about building DCE. I am assigning this CR to Doug Weir, who
is the Porting Guide owner. Doug, if you think this information
belongs in the release notes, let me know, and I'll reassign it
to Willie.

[10/26/94 public]

It is hard to be sure where to put something like this, but I did insert
it into Chapter 1 of the Porting Guide. I will also mention it to Willie
for the Release Notes.

DEC has provided OSF with the following new functionality for
the idl compiler.  It should be documented in the appropriate places.

Here is what Rico @ DEC gave me:


cut-here--------------------------------

0 Binding Handle Callout

This feature allows you to specify a routine that is automatically called
from an IDL-generated client stub routine, in order to modify the binding
handle.

A typical use of this feature is to augment the binding handle with
security context, for example so that authenticated RPC calls are used
between client and server.

This feature is particularly targeted at clients which use automatic
binding via the [auto_handle] ACF attribute.  For automatic binding, it
is the client stub rather than the client application code which obtains
a server binding handle.  The binding callout feature allows you to
modify binding handles obtained by the client stub.  Without this feature,
there is no way for you to modify the binding handles before the client
stub attempts to initiate a remote procedure call to the selected server.

0.1 ACF file

Select the binding handle callout feature by creating an ACF file for
the interface (if necessary) and placing the [binding_callout] attribute
on the interface, e.g.

    [auto_handle, binding_callout(my_bh_callout)] interface bindcall
    {
    }

The binding_callout attribute has the following general form:

    [binding_callout(<Identifier>)]

The binding_callout may only be specified once per interface and applies
to all operations in that interface.

0.2 Generated header file

The IDL-generated header file for the interface will contain a function
prototype for the binding callout routine.  For the example above,
bindcall.h contains a declaration similar to:

    void my_bh_callout(
        rpc_binding_handle_t *p_binding,
        rpc_if_handle_t interface_handle,
        error_status_t *p_st
    );

0.3 Generated client stub

Each client stub routine in the IDL-generated client stub module calls
the binding callout routine just prior to initiating the remote procedure
call to the server.  For the example above, each client stub routine
contains a call to my_bh_callout, passing the three arguments that are
described below.

0.4 Binding callout routine

The arguments to the binding callout routine are:

Input/Output:

rpc_binding_handle_t *p_binding
A pointer to a server binding handle for the remote procedure call.
Generally, the binding callout routine will augment this binding handle
with additional context, e.g. for security.

Input:

rpc_if_handle_t interface_handle
The interface handle.  This can be used to resolve a partial binding,
or for the binding callout routine to distinguish interfaces.

Output:

error_status_t *p_st
An error status code returned by the binding callout routine.

0.4.1 Error handling

A binding callout routine returns error_status_ok when it successfully
modifies the binding handle or decides that no action is necessary.
This causes the client stub to initiate the remote procedure call.

A binding callout routine can return an error status.  In this case, the
client stub will not initiate a remote procedure call.  If [auto_handle]
is being used, the client stub will attempt to locate another server of
the interface, and once again call the binding callout routine.  Otherwise,
it will execute its normal error handling logic.

A binding callout routine for a client using [auto_handle] can return
rpc_s_no_more_bindings to prevent the client stub from trying to locate
another server.  The client stub will then execute its normal error
handling logic.

A client stub by default handles an error condition by raising an exception.
If a binding callout routine returns a rpc_s_ status code, the client stub
by default will raise the matching rpc_x_ exception.  If a binding callout
routine returns any other error status, it will likely be raised as an
"unknown status" exception.

For an operation containing a [comm_status] parameter, the client stub
handles an error condition by returning the error status value in the
[comm_status] parameter.  A binding callout routine can return any error
status value to the client application code if the IDL operations are
specified with [comm_status] parameters.

A binding callout routine can raise a user-defined exception rather than
return a status code if it prefers to report application-specific error
conditions back to the client application code via exceptions.

0.5 Predefined binding callout routine

There is one predefined binding callout routine in the DCE library which
may be suitable for some applications.  This routine can be selected by
specifying a [binding_callout(rpc_ss_bind_authn_client)] ACF attribute.

rpc_ss_bind_authn_client matches the function prototype in 0.2.
It authenticates the client identity to the server, thereby allowing
for one-way authentication.  In other words, it means that the client does
not care which server principal receives the remote procedure call request,
but the server verifies that the client is who the client claims to be.

rpc_ss_bind_authn_client does the following:

  o calls rpc_ep_resolve_binding() to resolve the binding handle if it is
    not fully bound (e.g. for [auto_handle]).

  o calls rpc_mgmt_inq_server_princ_name() to obtain the server identitity
    (principal name)

  o calls rpc_binding_set_auth_info() with all default values except the
    server principal name obtained in the previous call.

  o if any of these calls returns an error status, that error status is
    placed in the *p_st argument and rpc_ss_bind_authn_client returns.


end-of-file-----------------------------

[5/13/94 public]

Assigned this CR to myself (I'm the OSF writer responsible
for IDL documentation).

[7/20/94 public]

Added a new section to the Attribute Configuration File chapter
that describes the binding_callout ACF interface attribute.
Also added binding_callout to ACF summary lists, tables and
the ACF bnf.

Still need to create a new man page for rpc_ss_bind_authn_client()
in the App Ref.

[7/20/94 public]

Created new man page for rpc_ss_bind_authn_client(). Marked
this CR as fixed, will pass copy to T. Jordahl for verification.

[10/27/94 public]
A doc person should mark this closed.

From a cursory inspection of the code it seems that the keyseed argument to
sec_create_db is essentially a password. Yet, and despite hints that the
user ought to think of the keyseed as a password (e.g. if the user is
prompted for the keyseed the input is not echoed), I can not find any
explicit statement to that effect in the documentation (in the
Administration Guide--Intro, the Administration Guide--Core Services or the
Administration Reference).

[4/21/94 public]

Assigning this CR to Pam Millett (HP security writer).
Description of keyseed occurs in 3 places

- Admin Guide Intro - in dce_config procedures (users are prompted
for it when configuring master security server and security replicas)

- Admin Guide - Core Components - section on creating master rgy database
with sec_create_db

- Admin Ref -  man page for sec_create_db

These files will need updating depending on resolution of the CR.

[4/21/94 public]
It is not a password.  Keyseed really is a good word for it.  You type this
in once to sec_create_db and never have to know it again.  Writing it down
would be a bad thing.  The registry is a principal and encrypts it's data
in a key.  To get the whole ball rolling it needs an initial random value,
which it turns into a key.

The keyseed should just be random junk.  It's probably better if it's
nothing that you can remember (like a password).

[4/21/94 public]

When I used the word "password" I was thinking of another attribute of
a password: that it should not be easy to guess. It certainly seems that 
this ought to be an attribute of the "keyseed" as well. I can see Howard's
point that other attributes of a password come to mind that should not be
characteristics of the keyseed but I do think that there should be a word
in the documentation about not selecting an easily guessed string (I use
"qwerty" all the time ;)) as the keyseed.

[04/21/94 public]
You know ksh has the $RANDOM variable...  I've always though doing
	if [ "x$RANDOM" -eq "x$RANDOM ] ; then
	    ...ask for a random text string for initial key...
	fi
I think "initial temporary key" is a better phrase then keyseed.

[04/21/94 public]
The keyseed entered by the user is neither a password nor a key.  
It is a string that is combined with a timestamp to
generate a temporary DES key which is used to "seed" a random
key generator that is used to generate a random
"master key."  The "master key" is the key (stored in the
/opt/dcelocal/var/security/.mkey file) used to encrypt the
rgy database account keys.  The "master key" is also used
to re-initialize the random key generator used to generate
random keys (e.g., for server accounts via ktadd -r).

[levy 04/21/94 public] 

Boy, will I ever learn to watch my language! Before the original point of
this CR gets completely buried, here it is one more time, put very plainly:
let's tell the user, somewhere in the documentation, that the
"whatchmacallit" should not be an easily guessed string.

[4/13/94 public]

Last fall I had a good deal of correspondence with DEC and SNI about some
errors in the GDS and CDS documentation.  The errors mainly concern the
relations between GDS and CDS attributes and between OM and CDS syntaxes.
This CR contains the relevant correspondence.

It looks as though the principal changes required are to the ds_add_entry,
ds_bind, ds_compare, and ds_modify_entry reference pages in the Application
Development Reference and the "XDS and the DCE Cell Namespace" chapter of
the Application Development Guide, particularly tables 2, 3, and 4 in that
chapter.

Subject: Question on GDS/CDS

        Bob,

        I'm an editor at DEC and we're incorporating some of the
        OSF info into our own X.500 product.  I have a question
        about a statement on some manpages.

        The last bullet in the Notes section of the ds_add_entry,
        ds_compare, and ds_modify_entry includes begins with this
        statement:

        	GDS-structured attribute types are not supported by
        	CDS.

        None of the engineers I've spoken to here can figure out what
        this means.  If the word "structured" is removed, the
        statement is false.  But what does the word "structured"
        refer to?  We've thought of several possibilities, but nothing
        that seems to us what was intended.

        Could you forward this to whoever could give us an answer?
        We need one soon!

        Thanks.

        Susan Hunziker

I would say: The terminus "structured" is a GDS one. But you find

I don't know the manual very well. But at least in this example 
you are right: It should be "structural". But anyway: The whole story
with the object classes has nothing to do with the terminus "structured
attributes".

Ok. The story is the following:
You can use all known attributes at the XDS interface. XDS just passes 
them to the DUA (which is a part of gds and located in libdce). The DUA
goes
into a "switch" that decides whether the name of the object is a X.500
name or a CDS name (marked by a typeless object identifier in one
relative distinguished name). Still no attributes are checked.
If the name is a CDS name the name and the attributes have to be
converted to the structures used by CDS. Especially there is a mapping
of the attributes. CDS itsself doesn't support the X.500 attribute
syntaxes - CDS is not a X.500 implementation. As far as I know
CDS has attribute syntaxes like "dns_char", dns_byte", dns_long",
"dns_uuid" and "dns_Timestamp". So there is no chance to map
i.e. a OR address in a unique way onto an CDS attribute. You could encode
the OR address into an octet string and store it in CDS as an "dns_byte";
but when you read it you don't know that it has been a OR address before.

So, the sentence in the manual simply means: It's impossible to store 
structured attributes (that are all attributes except the basic ones:
integers, strings, attributes with syntax ASN.1) in CDS. But a storage of
(or a compare with) structured attributes is not rejected by XDS 
(XDS doesn't know if the operation goes to CDS or GDS) but by the switch
in the DUA.

I think the manual should define exactly what can be added to CDS and
what not. Here is the list that I just took from the code:

X.500 representation		mapped to CDS representation:

T61 string				dns_char
Printable string			dns_char
Numeric string				dns_char
distinguished name			dns_char
Boolean					dns_long
Integer					dns_long
Octet string				dns_byte
Object identifier			dns_byte
ASN.1 syntax				dns_byte
PSAP address				dns_byte

The other direction is the following:

CDS representation		mapped to XDS representation:

dns_long			OCTET STRING
dns_char			TELETEX STRING
dns_long			INTEGER
dns_Timestamp			OCTET STRING
dns_uuid			OCTET STRING

I know that it looks strange. I. e. you can add an attribute with
a representation PRINTABLE but if you read from CDS you get it as an
T61 string. That means the mapping is not really unique. 
May be there are better solutions but definitely there
is no way to use CDS as a X.500 server. Because of that we have gds:
to store X.500 attributes (and more).

So, I hope it's enough for the first moment. Please ask me what ever
you want. But I'm not a real XDS expert; my responsibility is
normally the DUA and the ASN.1 encoding/decoding. The XDS expert
is Vinnie Ryan. But: The problem you wanted to discuss was more
a DUA problem; so you asked (may be) the right man but called him
wrong.

Bye,
		Jochen.

Jochen,

Thanks very much for the reply.  I'm glad that the question
found a knowledgeable person to answer it, even if in a
round-about way.

Let me ask the following to make sure I completely
understand it.  If you use XDS to store an attribute in CDS
(ds_modify, ds_compare, and any others), then the
attribute's syntax must be one of those listed below under
X.500 representation.  If you pass in an attribute with any
other syntax you will get a constraint violation.  The issue
has nothing to do with GDS attributes in particular, it is
related purely to the syntax of the attribute.  Correct?

Thanks again.

Howard

In the table above, did you mean the first entry to be dns_byte =>
OCTET STRING?  Also, did you omit dns_Version => INTEGER?

Two tables like these are actually in the documentation now.  They are
in the Application Development Guide, at the end of chapter 24 ("XDS and
the DCE Cell Namespace").

However, the tables in the documentation are not quite the same as
those derived from the code:

(1) The first of your tables in the book, Table 24-3, maps OM syntaxes
to CDS syntaxes.  It does not have an entry for distinguished name or
for PSAP address (are there OM syntaxes for these?).  It also does not
have an entry for ASN.1, though it has one for OM_S_ENCODING (this
should be OM_S_ENCODING_STRING) -- are these equivalent?  Should this
table be using OM syntaxes at all, or something else?

(2) The second of your tables in the book, Table 24-4, maps CDS syntaxes
to OM syntaxes.  It contains some entries that I do not see in the code:

cds_none => OM_S_NULL
cds_short => OM_S_INTEGER
cds_small => OM_S_INTEGER

Also, it has a typo -- it should say cds_Version, not cds_version.
Again, should this table be using OM syntaxes, or something else?  Do
you know of any reason to prefer, for example, cds_Version vs.
dns_Version as the CDS syntax names?  They seem to be equivalent, and it
is confusing to use different names in these two tables.

(3) The book also has a table, Table 24-2, that maps some CDS attributes
to OM syntaxes.  For example, CDS_Class maps to OM_S_OCTET_STRING.  Do
you know the source of this table?  I don't see any obvious place in the
code that does this translation.  Do you know why the table lists only
some of the CDS attributes?

Thank you for this text.  It looks right to me.  The only thing I'm not
sure about is which OM syntaxes correspond to "distinguished name" and
"PSAP address."  I assume they are included in this list.

Perhaps you have noticed the tables in the Application Development
Guide, at the end of chapter 24 ("XDS and the DCE Cell Namespace").  Two
of the three tables correspond to the information Jochen sent, but they
appear to have errors.  I am enclosing below part of a reply I sent to
Jochen asking him about these tables.  He hasn't answered me yet.  If
you know the answers to my questions, I would appreciate hearing from
you.

According to the source control logs for that chapter, Suzanne Lipsky
added these tables on Feb. 23, 1993.  Do you know who or what was her
source for the tables?  Table 24-2, the first one, is particularly
mysterious.

Following is the relevant part of my reply to Jochen:

I'm a programmer. Please contact directly the project manager
Rudolf Wildgruber. He has to organize that the code and the documentation
fit. I've sent him a copy of your latest mail, that means he knows
the problems.

Subject: ds_add_entry manpage

	Hi Bob,

        We added some more info to our version of this manpage, and
        I wanted to pass it along.

        -----------------
        The second bullet in Notes section reads:

	o  The DS_A_OBJECT_CLASS attribute of an object 
	is single valued in CDS and multivalued in GDS.

        We added this info to it:

	If the Entry argument contains a DS_A_OBJECT_CLASS
	attribute with a value of DS_O_ALIAS, a CDS alias (soft link) 
	will be created.  If the attribute value is DS_O_GROUP_OF_NAMES,
	a CDS Group object will be created.  Any other value for 
	DS_A_OBJECT_CLASS, in the absence of this attribute, will result 
	in the creation of an ordinary CDS object.
        --------------------

        Also I do have some info for you on the questions you sent last
        week.  I'll send it along today or tomorrow.

Subject: Comments for the DCE App. Dev. Guide and Reference

	Bob, 

        I've been away from DCE for a *long* time and am just now
        getting back to it and to you with corrections and some
        information for the DCE App. Dev. Guide and App. Dev
        Reference.  (I should clean my office more often.)

        Anyway, here they are, with many apologies for my
        tardiness.

        *Susan

        =======================================================

        First, old business re: the Guide.  In an exchange we had
        about GDS/XDS we had last fall, you made this comment:

<<Perhaps you have noticed the tables in the Application Development
<<Guide, at the end of chapter 24 ("XDS and the DCE Cell Namespace").  Two
<<of the three tables correspond to the information Jochen sent, but they
<<appear to have errors.  

        Before Bob Brady left DEC, he gave me corrections for two of 
        these tables.

	o  In Table 24-3, the items in the CDS data type column have a
           prefix of dns_.  It should be cds_.

           The last line currently reads OM_S_ENCODING.  It should
           read OM_S_ENCODING_STRING.

        o  In Table 24-4, this line

           	cds_version	OM_S_INTEGER_STRING
           
           should be changed to this:

                cds_Version	OM_S_INTEGER


        Second, I have some comments for the ds_add_entry, ds_bind,
        ds_compare, and ds_modify_entry ref. pages that Bob made  to
        more fully describe the behavior of CDS and X.500 that were 
        true as of last fall.   I realize that some things may have
        changed in the interim, but if they haven't, you may want to
        have this information.

        When Bob added comments to the existing text, I'll put his
        words in ALL CAPS.  If he added a separate paragraph, I'll
        note it.

        DS_ADD_ENTRY

        o  Only leaf objects (that is, objects that are not CDS
        directory objects) can be added to CDS throught the XDS
        interface, THAT IS, THE IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR OF THE NEW ENTRY
        MUST ALREADY EXIST.

        o  The DS_A_OBJECT_CLASS attribute of an object is single
        valued in CDS and multivalued in X.500.  If the entry argument
        contains a DS_A_OBJECT_CLASS attribute with a value of
        DS_O_ALIAS, a CDS alias (soft link) will be created.  IN THIS
        CASE, THE TARGET OF THE SOFT LINK IS SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE OF
        THE DS_A_ALIASED_OBJECT_NAME ATTRIBUTE.  If the attribute
        value is DS_O_GROUP_OF_NAMES, a CDS Group object will be
        created.  IN THIS CASE, THE GROUP MEMBERS ARE SUPPLIED AS THE
        VALUES OF THE DS_A_MEMBERS ATTRIBUTE.


        DS_BIND

        (last paragraph in description section)

        DS_DEFAULT_SESSION may also be used when X.500 is active.  The
        returned Bound Session object may then be used for operations
        in both namespaces.

        DS_COMPARE

        (additional bullet at the end of the description section)

        o  If the name parameter supplied to the Compare function is a
        CDS soft link and the Dont_Dereference_Aliases context
        parameter is set TRUE, then the only allowed attribute for
        comparison is the DS_A_ALIASED_OBJECT_NAME, whose value will
        be compared with the Distinguished Name of the soft link's
        target.

        DS_MODIFY_ENTRY

        o  In CDS, the name parameter supplied to the Modify Entry
        function must [delete these words: ultimately resolve to]
        BE the name of a leaf....

        o  (last item in bulleted list in description section)

        In CDS, if the name  parameter supplied to the Modify Entry
        function is that of a CDS soft link, and the
        Dont_Dereference_Alias flag is set TRUE, the modification will
        be to the soft link entry itself.  In this case, the only
        allowed modifications are to the DS_A_ALIASED_OBJECT_NAME
        attribute.

[4/18/94 public]

Assigned the GDS (app_ref) portion of this CR to
Rich Nollman (SNI GDS writer). See CR10387 for
assignment of CDS (app_gd) portion.

[08/17/94 public]

Remark for:
        o  In Table 24-4, this line

           	cds_version	OM_S_INTEGER_STRING
           
           should be changed to this:

                cds_Version	OM_S_INTEGER

See OT 11222: adding of cds_version attribute didn't work at all.

I've just corrected this - so I know how it is implemented.

According to the example given in the chapter 3.3.2.2. you add
cds_version via XDS as a OM_S_PRINTABLE_STRING : i.e. "1.0"

This string should have the correct syntax, which means:
first char < 10, second char = '.', third char < 10.
This is mapped to cds_version.Maj = 1, cds_version.Min = 0.

If you read cds_version from CDS via XDS you will get it back as
OM_S_PRINTABLE_STRING : "1.0"

So the line in the table should be:

		cds_Version	OM_S_PRINTABLE_STRING

(May be the syntax of the string should be described additionally ...)

Any comments?

[10/17/94 public]
The difference of using XDS over CDS vs. GDS should be documented in a
more detailed way. However, this would require extensive changes to some
manpages (ds_add_entry, ds_bind, ds_compare, and ds_modify_entry).
It is too late to get the changes done before the doc tree is
frozen. Therefore deferred.

[10/26/94 public]
These changes have been made. They didn't actually amount to many--
just a total of four or five in two (I think) tables at the end of
the XDS/CDS Chapter, which is now Chapter 3 of the Directory Service
Application Guide.

[10/26/94 public]
Oops, I see I jumped the gun. I just noticed Jochen's comment above.
What I did was make all the changes that applied to the Application
Guide XDS/CDS chapter; I did not make any changes to the manpages as
suggested by Jochen. So I am restoring the "defer" marking.

[6/30/95 public]

Assigned to HP for DCE 1.2.

[7/23/96 public]
I have made the changes to the manpages suggested in the mail
between Bob Mathews and Susan Hunziker and I have marked this 
CR as fixed.

The manpages I fixed are ds_add_entry.3xds, ds_compare.3xds, and 
ds_modify.3xds.  I couldn't find the text to change in the others.
 
If the differences in using XDS vs. CDS vs. GDS should still be 
described, we really should do it under a new CR that supplies the 
information required to create this doc.  As it stands  now, the 
CR is now almost impossible to follow.  

I've marked this bug as fix, leaving OSF to verify and close it.

[7/31/96 public]
Status changed to verified.  If other changes should be 
made, please open a new CR.

The intro.[1-9]* ref pages need to be given unique names.  The main problem
is that some man commands cannot deal with files that have more than
single-digit extensions.  When the longer DCE extensions are truncated,
name conflicts result.  For example, intro.1rpc and intro.1dce both map to
intro.1.  The solution decreed by Hal Lichtin is to rename all intro ref
pages to <component>_ref.[1-9]*.  For example, intro.1rpc becomes
rpc_intro.1rpc.

[4/11/94 public]

I've made the changes above, with one exception: I couldn't "defunct" the
file dce_books/app_ref/man3xds/intro.3xds because Richard Nollman has it
checked out.  Following are the new files:

./admin_ref/man4dfs/dfs_intro.4dfs

./admin_ref/man8cds/cds_intro.8cds
./admin_ref/man8dce/dce_intro.8dce

./app_ref/man3xds/xds_intro.3xds
./app_ref/man3xom/xom_intro.3xom
./app_ref/man4xds/xds_intro.4xds

For all these files except ./app_ref/man3dts/dts_intro.3dts, the original
file was named intro.<n><comp>.  The 3dts intro was named time_intro.3dts.

In addition, I updated the Description files in admin_ref and app_ref.

Note that I did not update cross-references to the old intro files.  There
are many.  Following is my best guess at the list of files that contain
cross-references to the old intro ref pages:

[4/18/94 public]

Created new CRs 10388, 10389, 10390 to cover the
cross-reference corrections listed in this CR on
a per-book basis. Reassigning this CR to myself
for tracking.

[9/6/94 public]

I'm reassigning this CR to Julie Buckler, because
she is now the DCE 1.1 doc "bugmeister". This is
a "tracking" CR that she can use when verifying
that the CRs 10388, 10389, and 10390 have been fixed.

[09/13/94 public]
Raised priority to "2" for consistency with other cross-ref CRs.

[10/27/94 public]
Marking this one verified.  All Intro pages have been created properly.
Any cross referencing that was not done will be noted by leaving the
appropriate CR open.

This CR covers moving the DFS chapters of the Application Development Guide
and the Application Development Reference to the supp_docs/redistrib
directory.

[4/5/94 public]

I've completed all the structural work for this.  I put the Application
Development Guide and Reference material together into a single book, in
the directory supp_docs/redistrib/dfs_app_gdref.  I created all the
boilerplate files necessary to build this as a real book.

I made no attempt to identify or fix any cross-references to material that
I removed, other than to update the App Dev Ref preface.  Someone should
check for these references.

[4/21/94 public]

Reassigned this CR to myself. I'll check for cross-references and
parcel out the work to the various book owners.

[10/24/94 public]

All cross-references to DFS documentation still need to be checked
and changed to cover the reorganization of the DFS docs (some may
already have been fixed, but someone needs to verify that ALL
have been fixed.) Marked this CR "defer to 1.2".

[11/1/94 public]

Since this has devoloved to a "check the Cross Refs" issue, I am reopening
for 1.1 Prentice Hall work.

[9/14/95 public]

For the above reason, and since this bug was never closed, I'm
reassigning it to myself until we can make sure it was fixed.

[2/27/96 public]

Fixed and verified.

gdssysadm has a new 'authentication method' feature.  It may have a command
line switch to represent this (although I have yet to discover what it is)
and that should be documented in the gdssysadm manpage.

Ah, here it is:

I have changed the output of dce_config slightly, and the docs should
be changed to reflect this.

- The question about multiple-LANs has changed its wording
- When installing the application development evironment, it no
  loger lists the names of the files it is installing in /usr/include/dce.
   It does, however, print the names of the symbolic links it wants
  to make in /usr/include.
- Configure Auditing has been added to the additional server menu.

Other things (such as menus) may change in dce_config for 1.1, and the
sample output in the entire chapter should be verified for correctness.

Currently there is no description of the manual setup for the xt_test tests -

It's also mentioned that you should run some tetized tests (i.e. admin)
before - so you have the configuration for running single xt_test tests.

[3/17/94 public]
The documentation for RPC pipes is inadequate.  In particular, what does it
mean for "pull/push/allocate "to "coordinate" their activities, and what is
the role of "state" in doing this?  A *complete* example is needed, not the
mere fragments that are currently present.  Furthermore, there is at least
one mistake in the docs: "state" is described as "char *" but in the actual
implementation it's rpc_ss_pipe_state_t (= idl_void_p_t = void *).
Finally, the existing "IDL Pipes Example" purports to show what the IDL
compiler generates from the input "typedef pipe base_t pipe_t;", but the
example code shows "element_t" instead of "base_t".  The example code also
shows comments, but the IDL compiler generates no such comments.

[3/17/94 public]
I forgot to mention that, apart from the datatype of state noted above, the
documented signature of "push" is wrong (it should be idl_ulong_int ecount,
not *ecount).  Also, note that even though the comments remarked on above
should go away, the information in them needs to be retained (e.g., whether
bsize's and bcount's refer to bytes or elements).  BTW, the version of the
docs I'm looking at is the Prentice-Hall App Dev Gd, Section 17.14.4.

OT CR's 9926 and 10107 mean some SVC manpages will need to be changed.
See those CR's for details.

[3/24/94 public]

Assigned this CR to Doug Weir (OSF DCE serviceability writer).

[10/26/94 public]
This has to do with svc use of the __FILE__ macro. The information
has been added to the SVC chapter of the App Gd and to Chapter 2 of
the Porting Guide.

The sams utility and the code set registry compiler csrc both
use strdup(). Some C libraries do not have strdup(), e.g., Ultrix
(but all the DCE 1.1 reference platforms do). As a result, a
DCE porting step will be to ensure that strdup() is available.
The sams compiler ifdefs the function (see sams.c) and it looks
like the porter needs to know that s/he needs to toggle a machine-
dependent switch (looks like "NEED_STRDUP") to get the function
built into sams if necessary. For the csrc utility, they'll need
to copy the ifdef'd strdup() code from sams.c (as I understand it
from Mariko).

[3/2/94 public]

Rich feels csrc utility should use #ifdef NEED_STRDUP approach as
well, so the porting will be easier.  I agree with Rich, and will
add #ifdef NEED_STRDUP to csrc code.

[5/6/94 public]
Added #ifdef NEED_STRDUP around strdup() function.  Submitted csrc.c
with other changes to csrc.

[10/26/94 public]
This information is in a separate section at the beginning of Chapter
2 of the Porting Guide.

[2/21/94 public]
The third paragraph in the DESCRIPTION section of the pthread_join() reference
page consists of the following sentence:
 
   "If the current thread calls this routine, a deadlock results."
 
Some developers here at Transarc found this sentence a little vague.  They
asked that it be clarified.  I think the following simple text provides the
required clarification:
 
   "If the current thread calls this routine to join with itself, a
                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    deadlock results."
 
I think the additional text accurately captures what is implied by the
existing text.  If the new text is correct and you have the time to include
it, this seems like a simple way to provide a little more information on the
topic.  You guys know the subject matter better than I do, so you can judge,
but some small clarification may be in order.
 
[Hal:  I assigned the defect to you for proper assigment to the appropriate
       Digital writer; thanks.]

Documentation related to the code set registry needs to
be added to the DCE documentation set. Specifically,

- a man page for the code set registry compiler (csrc)
  needs to be added to Section 8 of the Administration
  Reference (which will be the Command Reference at 1.1)

- man pages for the code set registry access routines
  (dce_loc_to_rgy(), dce_rgy_to_loc()) need to be
  added to the RPC section (3rpc) of the Application
  Development Reference (these routines were originally planned
  for the (3dce) section but are now considered to be
  part of RPC code and are defined in rpc.h)

- information for system administrators about creating
  a code set registry source file and running csrc
  needs to be added to a "Post-Installation and
  Configuration" section in Volume 1 of the DCE
  Administration Guide (the volume that will
  describe dce_config).

- information for DCE licensees about creating
  a code set registry source file and running
  csrc needs to be added to the Porting Guide
  (this task is covered in CR9783).

[1/26/94 public]
The porting guide, early on, should describe using dce.h to address some
form of ANSI C problems.  Remember, 1.1 assumes an ANSI C compiler.  If
your compiler is deficient in some way, you can use dce.h to add a #define
that will be in virtually every dce source file.

For example, if your compiler doesn't understand the "volatile" keyword,
you could put the following in dce.h to get rid of them:  

  #define volatile

Now, dce.h is not the only file that *can* be used for this.  If the
problem is in RPC code, perhaps there is a better RPC header file to use,
putting things in dce.h means they are exposed to virtually EVERY DCE and
*DCE application* source file, so some caution should be used.

There other examples aside from volatile, const for one.
See also globalref in RPC code which is useful for VMS ports in particular.

Finally there are some macros that are component specific that are related.
For example, RPC uses:

  VOLATILE_NOT_SUPPORTED 
  CONST_NOT_SUPPORTED 

In RPC (check with Charlie Brooks) these can be used to handle the absence
of volatile or const support from a compiler.  They do not affect all
components.

[2/1/94 public]

In response to requests from John Bowe, MaryAnn Paratore, and
Hal Lichtin, I have attempted to reclassify this CR from "unknown"
to something else. Because the subject of the CR is dce.h, I reassigned
the "component" field to "utils"; because the reason for the CR relates to
code cleanup, I assigned "cln" to the subcomponent field,
along with "port_gd", which identifies the affected document
(prior to DCE 1.1 the doc group used the subcomponent field
exclusively, to identify the affected document(s)).

If information about using component-specific files to cope
with non-ANSI C compilers needs to be added to the Porting
Guide (see Howard's entry, above), it's my thought that the
CRs opened opened for these would assign, for example, "rpc" to
the component field, and "cln, port_gd", to the subcomponent field.

This information is in a section titled "DCE 1.1 and ANSI C" in

The Porting Guide will need some documentation on i18n-related stuff.
Specifically:

- DCE 1.1 i18n routines will require that DCE clients and servers
support code set converters for the ISO 10646 code set. This means
that operating system platforms that intend to support DCE i18n routines
will need to provide this converter.

- The DCE 1.1 tape will include this code set converter.

- Vendors who care about supporting i18n'd applications
(that is, apps that will use the new RPC/IDL functionality)
will need to add this code set converter to their
platform's code set conversion mechanism. If that
mechanism is the POSIX iconv code set conversion routines,
then they need to ensure that the ISO 10646 converter
works with their version of the iconv routines (each
platform's iconv is a little different, as I understand
it).

- Vendors who have a code set converter mechanism that
is NOT the POSIX iconv mechanism will need to port
the ISO 10646 converter to their mechanism.

I don't know what level of detail we'll be required
to give about either porting process. The responsible
engineer for this piece is Mariko. Currently, she
thinks that perhaps using HP's port of the converter
onto HP's implementation of iconv would be a good example
to put in the Guide (Mariko is working with Sue Klein of HP
on this port). As for amount of info/details about porting
to non-iconv platforms...currently unknown.

I'm assigning this CR for the time being to Doug Weir (it could be
a temporary assignment).


The iconv converters are required for RPC automatic code set conversion
mechanism.  So I assigned this CR to 'rpc' component.

[2/1/94 public]

Here (from Mariko Romagna) is more i18n porting information that 
needs to be included in the Porting Guide:

  The C library function call 'nl_langinfo()' returns a requested
attribute of the current locale.  For example, when 'nl_langinfo(CODESET)'
is called, it should return the current locale's code set name.
The RPC runtime code sets evaluation functions depend on this
functionality being present in the base OS.

  OSF/1 and AIX have this functionality, but HP-UX lacked this
support (so they had to add this functionality to their C library)
and SVR4 is lacking this support as well.

  Note that both HP-UX and SVR4 have the function call 'nl_langinfo()';
however, on these platforms, the function does not return the
current locale's code set when 'CODESET' is requested, even though
CODESET is defined in the standard include file.

  The only way to discover the presence or absence of this functionality
is to execute the following little program in different locales:

        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <locale.h>
        #include <langinfo.h>

        main(void)
        {
                setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
                printf("%s\n", nl_langinfo(CODESET));
        }

  So what happens when the base OS is lacking this functionality?  When
DCE 1.1 is ported to that platform, four code set compatibility evaluation
routines within the RPC runtime need to be modified.

  So far, two out of three commercial OSes (except OSF/1) have this
problem, so I think it's important to document this requirement to
Porting Guide.  Even though an OS has a nl_langinfo() call, it does not
automatically mean that it has all of the functionality needed for the
i18n code sets i14y features to work.

While working with Ron Sasala to write up the pthreads error messages, 
I came across the following changes that need to be made in the DCE 
Application Reference.  All references to pages are from the Application
Programming Reference, dated April 14, 1993, which is the OSF printed
version for the 1.0.2 release.

Page 1-56, the text for EINVAL should read, "The value specified for attr
is invalid."  Remove 'kind.'

Page 1-63, the text for ENOTSUP should read 'priority,' not 'policy.'

Page 1-16, EPERM should be added for pthread_attr_setprio as follows:

   -1   EPERM   The caller does not have the appropriate priveleges to set
                the priority of the specified thread.

Page 1-18, in the Returned Values, the description of EPERM should be
changed to say 'policy,' not 'priority.'

Page 1-61, the description for CANCEL_ON and CANCEL_OFF should read
'General,' not 'Asynchronous.'

Page 1-58 indicates that -1 is returned for pthread_once if there is an
invalid parameter, but there is no error indicated in the Returned-Values
table.  This should be an error EINVAL.

Page 1-63, ESRCH does not apply to pthread_setprio and should be deleted.

Page 1-65, ESRCH does not apply to pthread_setschedular and should be
deleted.

[1/19/94 public]

CORRECTION:  The last two items above SHOULD NOT be changed.  ESRCH does
apply to pthread_setprio and pthread_setschedular.

[10/26/94 public]

This is my fault-- some of these have not been done after all. Here
is a more precise list of exactly what needs to be or has been changed.

Two items, marked with asterisks below, are still outstanding. These
are deferred to 1.2.

The DCE Porting and Testing Guide section 7.1.2 Data Encryption Mechanisms
for DCE Security Service needs changes. Text should be added for U.S. govt.
regualations/requirement for DES outside of U.S. Also, the default for the
DCE source code from OSF is not the option 2, but option 1 which provides
data privacy. There should be mention of USE_DES and NOENCRYPTION
compile-time options which are required to be set to generate each of these
three options to get the correct binaries: domestic with data privacy, 
domestic/export with data integrity and export only with no encryption. The

There are more steps required for a DCE machine ip address change
that what is listed in section 6.2.

In addition to the steps mentioned you also need to change the
following where applicable:

  /.:/hosts/<machine>/self
  /.:/hosts/<machine>/cds-server
  /.:/hosts/<machine>/cds-clerk


The above-listed CDS object contain bindings which are exported at
DCE-config time and never checked upon daemon restart.  In order
to ensure that they have the proper address, do the following
(The example is for self, and all the others work the same way). 

cdscp show object /.:/hosts/<machine>/self


If the ip address listed in the Tower attribute is incorrect then
invoke rpccp and unexport the binding:

rpccp unexport -i <ifuuid> /.:/hosts/<machine>/self

The uuid for <ifuuid> can be obtained by looking at dce_config for
the place where it exports a binding to /.:/hosts/<machine>/self

Now issue:  

rpccp export -i <ifuuid> -b ncagd_ip_udp:<your-new-ip>[135] \
    /.:/hosts/<machine>/self



/.:/hosts/<machine>/dts-entity also has old address exported
to it.  I don't know how to get rid of the old cruft for
this object; it does not behave the same way as "self" does.


If you are also running DFS, you will then need to issue
the fts edserver -server <old.ip.addr> -changeaddr <new.ip.addr>

For every DFS server who has undergone an ip address change.


You may then restart all of the flservers in the cell so that
they recognize the new address.  You may also have to restart
DCE as well, and remove the CDS cache before restarting the
flservers.

[1/5/94 public]

Add to the manual intervention list:

    /.:/hosts/hostname/dts-entity

If this cds object has an incorrrect ip address in its tower attribute, 
you must stop dtsd on that host, delete the /.:/hosts/hostname/dts-entity 
object and restart dtsd.

Assigned this CR to Doug Weir, who created the original
section 6.2, "Changing the Netowrk Address of a DCE Machine"
for R1.0.3.

[01/06/94 public]
While I think its a good idea to keep track of the existing problems
when ip addresses are changed bear in mind that we are currently looking
at eliminating many of these steps for 1.1. If your looking at documenting
the behavior for that release I would wait until the dust has settled.
If your looking at what to doc for 1.0.3a ignore this......

[1/7/94 public]
Changed to cfg since that's what we're talking about.

Also please in the doc don't say look in dce_config to get the ifuuid, we
should print the uuid in the text and give a reference of where they can
find it to cut and paste.  We probably want to give the rpccp show command
to display the ifuuid.

Since most of the commands are changing to use dcecp as well as changing to
used perhaps different methods I wouldn't worry.  We know what the fix is,
and I think we might as well get it into the doc so that a single pass can
be made to change it.  The above text isn't hard.  If the method changes
then we can fix the doc.  If something happens and we don't get to change
the mechanism, then at least what we are documenting is still correct.

Just my $0.02.

Reassigning this CR to Susan Teto (OSF's DCE configuration
writer).

[4/27/94 public]

Email from Doug Weir that gives further instructions
on how to address this CR:

Susan,

There is an exact writeup of the revised IP address change
procedure which I did for the 1.0.3a Release Notes. They
were approved by Diane then. All you have to do is put
them in the right place. It's in the 5th chapter of the
Release Notes located at:

/project/dce/build/dcedoc1.1/src/release_doc/relnotes_a/relnotes/5_docchanges.g
psml

and consists of the entirety (except for the first para-
graph) of the section entitled ``Changing the Network Ad-
dress of a DCE Machine''.

If dtsd is shutdown cleanly in 1.1, you do not have to remove
the dts-entity entry.  The ACL interface was not getting
unexported on shutdown for dce pre-1.1.

[10/24/94 public]
Corrected the instructions in 9_tasks.gpsml for changing a network address per
the ones in the OSF DCE Porting Guide.  Fixed them further for the new
cdsd function that automatically updates the addresses of CDS objects.
Verified changes with John Dugas.

The User's Guide mentions the very confusing switches -n and -c on the
modify command of acl_edit, as well as the purge command.  Most of these
mentions are in tables.  There is no section that describes their use
(Though section 4.7 "Using Masks" would be a perfect place :-)

This is a very confusing topic and deserves a complete description.  The
phrase "those objects that must recalculate the mask when modified" just
doesn't mean anything to me.  What does this mean.

[12/23/93 public]

The plan for DCE 1.1 is not to improve guide documentation
for control program functions that are being replaced by dcecp
functions, but to provide better guide documentation in the
context of using dcecp. Under this plan, it seems like
the appropriate place for an improved discussion of
how to use masks and how to handle them with dcecp is
in the dcecp sections of the DCE Administration Guide.
(This assumes that dcecp will implement the acl_edit
modify -n and -c functions as well as purge).

I am assigning this CR to Ward Rosenberry (OSF's dcecp
writer).

[10/24/94 public]

An improved discussion was developed and included in the admin guide
chapter on using ACLs as the last section in the chapter. This discussion

The manpage for pthread_mutexattr_getkind_np() says its one and only
parameter is of type pthread_mutexattr_t *, but the source shows
that it is of type pthread_attr_t, which is the same as
pthread_mutexattr_t. In other word, the man page should not say that attr
is a pointer type.

After discussing this with SNI we have decided to leave things as they are.
It is unrealistic to expec this to be addressed in the forseable future,
and the pages will remain in the doc set as a reminder, so I am canceling
this CR.

[3/10/94 public]
Sorry, I'm not trying to start an OT war, but I don't think that we can
just cancel this.  If we don't want to write real manpages then we have to
make sure that new copies of the header files are used.  With all the work
going on in GDS -- code cleanup, SVC, I18N, etc -- it's almost certain that
all these files will be touched.

[10/17/94 public]
Seems to be done - will be verified soon.

[10/27/94 public]
OK - header file text in the manpages and the header files in the dce1.1 tree
are consistent now. However - the original subject of this OT was:
It's not very nice to have header file text as a manpage.
This is still not fixed.
I'll set this OT to "verified" because of the discussion in this OT -
Rich Z seems to agree with the solution we have now.
Rich Z should open a new defect for dce1.2 - hopefully we'll have
better manpages for DCE 1.2.

Hitachi Noted that in trying to port our threads package to
kernel space, that they encountered a race condition in cma__wait
and cma__timed_wait. This race condition arises because these routines

unlock the mutex before "entering the kernel". This implementation exists
because doing the inverse would result in a deadlock on at least the
PMAX implementation of DCE threads.

    cma__int_unlock ((mutex)); \
    cma__enter_kernel (); \

see cma__wait and cma__timed_wait in file src/threads/cma_condition.h

Their should be a note in the porting and testing guide in the section
about threads, which captures this fact so it need not be learned by 
each porter of DCE threads to kernel threads.

Need to add the following new Serviceability reference pages to
the Application Development Reference:

	man1dce/sams.1dce
	man3dce/dce_assert.3dce
	man3dce/dce_svc_register.3dce (catch-all for svc.3dce routines)
	man3dce/dce_svc_define_filter.3dce (catch-all for svcfilter.3dce
						routines)
	man3dce/dce_svc_routing.3dce (catch-all for svcimpl.3dce routines)
	man3dce/dce_svc_log_open.3dce (originally svclog.3dce)
	man5dce/svcroute.5dce

The man3dce reference pages will need to be split so that each
routine is described on a separate reference page.  Sections for
Input Parameters, Output Parameters, Return Values, Files, and
Related Information will also need to be added.
The source for these new ref pages was provided by Rich Salz.
Further changes to content may be necessary as DCE 1.1 proceeds.

I have already bcreated these files, added the new subdirectories
for man1dce and man5dce, and updated the App Dev Ref Description file.

[10/17/93 public]
I added corrections from Rich Salz, John Bowe, and Julie Salamone 
to same.1dce.

Subject: RPC: Why use rpc_ss_allocate and rpc_ss_free?
Date: Fri, 21 Aug 92 09:24:53 -0400


> in the acf there is an attribute enable_allocate which
> "turns on " the ability to use the rpc_ss_allocate routines.
> if pointers are used this ability is turned on automatically..

================================================================

Looking up rpc_ss_free in the reference guide you see...  

These routines are usually called by server code.  The
runtime calls rpc_ss_free at appropriate times.  On the
sever side the stub calls rpc_ss_free as one of the last
things it does.  

So say your manager routine has to allocate memory, if it
uses rpc_ss_allocate, the stub will free it for the manager.
Why not just have the manager use malloc() and free()?  Say
the manager routine was getting a linked list and adding it
to it.  It has to allocate memory and give it to the runtime
to pass back to the client.  So the runtime needs the
memory, the manager can't call free(), if the stub doesn't
free it, you have a leak.  So the manager uses
rpc_ss_allocate() and the stub frees it with rpc_ss_free()
after its done marshalling, and passing it over the wire.

Howard

================================================================

The basic difference between malloc/free and rpc_ss_allocate/free
is that all memory from multiple rpc_ss_allocate calls is
automatically deallocated as a last step of a server stub, after
the output values have been transmitted back to the client.

Depending on the application, a manager may wish use to use this
memory management policy.  This is akin to growable stack frames,
or a zoned allocation model.

A manager can obviously still malloc storage, and this storage
will persist across invocations.

New Security terms needed for DCE Glossary:

	ACL Manager
	project list
	Object ACL
	initial container ACL
	Initial object ACL
	container
	simple object
	default cell (Security - in ACLs)
	mask types (e.g., mark_obj, unauthenticated, etc.)
	mutual authentication
	DCE Security Service
	alias (Security)
	subject ID
	account
	group member (Security)
	replication (Security)
	organization
	organization member

Terms with (Security) after them mean that there is already
a general definition but a Security-specific definition needs
to be added.

[6/22/93 public]

[5/24/94 public]

Here are glossary terms supplied by Pam Millett:

DELETE REFERENCE FOR MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION SURROGATE IN THE GLOSSARY.  IT'S
NOW CALLED  foreign cell surrogate.  NEW  foreign cell surrogate DEF IS 
SUPPLIED.

project list 
    A list of all the groups in which a principal 
    is a member.   The project list is used to determine 
    the principal's access rights to objects. 
    
container object
    An object that can hold another object.  For 
    example, a directory is a container object since it can 
    hold files.  See also simple object.
    
default cell
    Security:  With the \*Lsec_admin\*O and \*Lrgy_edit\*O commands, the
    cell in which the replica being acted on by the \*Lsec_admin\*O command
    is registered.

mask_obj mask
    When supported by an ACL manager type, the \*Lmask_obj\*O mask
    represents the greatest set of permissions granted to principals other
    than those that  match the \*Luser_obj\*O or \*Lother_obj\*O. 

unauthenticated mask 
    The maximum set of permissions granted when access to the object is
    not authenticated.  Unauthenticated access is granted only if the
    caller matches some ACL entry (frequently the \*Lany_other\*O entry)
    and if the required permission is granted by both the entry and the mask.
    
foreign cell surrogate 
    Principals (whose names are in the form \*Lkrbtgt/\*Vcell_name\*O) that
    are maintained in the registry database for the purpose of 
    intercell authentication.  To accomplish intercell authentication,
    the foreign cell surrogates in each cell's registry share a secret key.
    This secret key is known to both the local and foreign cell's
    Authentication Service. It is through their surrogates that two
    instances of the Authentication Service are able to convey information
    about their respective principals to one another, thus enabling a
    principal from one cell to acquire a ticket to a principal in another cell.
    See also trust peer.
    
alias
    Security: An optional alternate name for a primary name in the registry
    database.  Aliases and the primary name for which they are an
    alternate share the same Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) and UNIX
    ID.
    
account
    An entry in the registry database that defines 
    a principal's network identity  by associating the principal
    with a group and optional organization,and with
    related account information such as the password used to authenticate
    a principal's identity. 

replica
    Security:  An instance of the Security Server and its database.  One
    replica, the master replica, can accept updates and queries to its
    database. Other replicas, the slave replica, can accept only queries.
    
master replica
    Security:  An instance of a Security Server that accepts queries and
    updates to its associated registry database.  The master replica
    dynamically propagates its updates to slave replicas.  
    Each cell has only one master replica.  See also slave replica.

slave replica
    An instance of a Security Server that accepts only queries to its 
    associated registry database.  Slave replicas 
    are updated by the master replica.  Each cell can have many 
    slave replicas.  See also master replica.

[8/29/94 public]
These terms and additiona terms for 1.1 have been sent to willie.  
Can I get this CR verified and closed??

[09/12/94 public]
I added these entries to the glossary.

[11/4/92 public]

Much of the information in the `admin ref' guide could be used by an unprived
user. For example, the dtscp documentation of the `show current time' command
is something a USER could easily do. On the other hand, the ACL editor, while
usuable by a user, should not be appoached by the uninitated - indeed, 99% of
it's use will be by administrators.

I believe, much of the `admin ref' guide should be moved to the `user ref'
guide.

[11/20/92 public]
We had a lot of discussion on the separation between the user guide and ref
and the admin ref. We also distributed doc specs indicating our intentions.
Joe's comments are valuable and we should definitely consider them but we
can't do it in the 1.0.2 timeframe so I am deferring the CR to 1.0.3.

[5/4/93 public]
I am reopening this enhancement request for 1.1, not 1.0.3.  We are
determining what reorganization is appropriate as part of the 1.1
documentation planning process.  Changed severity to C (software
functionality limitation with acceptable workaround).  Reassigned to 1.1
doc project lead.

[06/10/93 public]
Changed "Responsible Engineer" to "osf".  Writer TBD.

[07/06/93 public]
Assigned to Doc Project Lead, Bob Mathews.  Current thinking is
that any utility accessible to an end user should be documented 
in the User's Guide, even if administrators use it for their own
tasks.  Bob can ensure that book owners move chapters or alter 
Description files as appropriate during 1.1.

[3/14/94 public]

The User's Guide and Reference is being defuncted at DCE 1.1.
The information in the Reference section is moving to the
Administration Reference. The information in the guide
portion that is not already duplicated in the Administration
Guide (90% is duplicated) will be moved to the appropriate
places in the Admin Guide. (For complete details, see the
documentation specification for the User's Guide and Reference
in /afs/dce.osf.org/project/dce1.1/doc/specs/ugd.ps).

Assigned this CR to myself since I am the one who is
defuncting the book.

[10/27/94 public]
Verifying this seems to hav this seems to have fallen through the cracks.
I consider this to have been well-enough done and am moving it to 
verified.

[3/29/94 public]

Reassigned this CR from Julie Buckler to myself. This CR is being
addressed by developing guide and API documentation for the
IDL and RPC runtime character and code set i14y functionality.
The IDL i18n character support documentation is covered by CR 9601
(along with other IDL doc enhancements for DCE 1.1).

[9/21/94 public]

The Intro to DCE also needs to explain the level of internationalization
provided by each DCE component.

Changed CR in Code, Doc, or Test? from `code' to `doc'

Filled in Fixed In Baseline with `1.0.3a' 
Filled in Affected File with `osi document'

[2/14/94 public]
The corrected text to jaffe@transarc's last comment should be
"This defect is closed with the submission of the osi document that was
shipped as part of the 1.0.3a closure.  Please open a new defect IF that
document is insufficient"

[2/22/94 public]
I have been informed that our engineers (rsarbo) consider the documentation
to be sufficient.  It is currently in the 1.0.3a Release Notes and must be
put in the 1.1 Porting Guide.  Therefore I am marking the CR open for 1.1
and assigning the CR to the Porting Guide writer.

[3/21/94 public]

I changed part of this OT before properly reading the other part. Now I'm
changing it back-- from "fix" to "open", because the OSI material referred
to should be put into the Porting Guide; putting it in the Release Notes
was only a temporary expedient. I'll re-mark it "fix" after I've put this
documentation into Chapter 8 of the Porting Guide.

[10/26/94 public]
It's now in the Porting Guide. The Chapter number is 11 now for DFS.
