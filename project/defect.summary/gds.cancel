Remove reference to pre-processor variable, OSFCDS_REFERRALS,
 from the Porting and Testing Guide.  The software does not build 
correctly when this is defined.  It appears that XDS switching
between GDS and CDS is not and will not be provided.  

Below is the question received from a customer.

==============================================================

From: Chen Xiao Liang (CEC) <chen@ssaws.yk.fujitsu.co.jp>

Hello, I am Chen, one of the member of Fujitsu DCE Porting Group.
I have some questions about the GDS pre-processor variable OSFCDS_REFERRALS.

It is written in 'DCE Porting and Testing Guide' that if OSFCDS and 
OSF_CDS_REFERRALS are not defined, the switch-support is not built in GDS.
  "Original: If OSFCDS and OSF_CDS_REFERRALS are defind The DUA checks to 
   see if it should be referring an operation to the CDS instead, and if so, 
   calls CDS through the DUA switch code. Otherwise, no switch suport is 
   compiled into GDS."

However, OSF_CDS_REFERRALS is not used anywhere in GDS sources.

Note: Instead of OSF_CDS_REFERRALS, OSFCDS_REFERRALS is used.

We corrected Makefile to define OSFCDS_REFERRALS and executed make,
but the error was reported and make was stopped.

  The error was "function d21_cds_referral() was not found."

  This symbol is defined at dua/switch/d21_cds_ref.c, but we show 
Makefile existed at dua/switch, d21_cds_ref.c is not in the list of 
compilation objects.

  Therefore, I have some questions as follows.

  Q:Should I define the pre-processor variable OSFCDS_REFERRALS?  

  If the answer is NO, then questions
  Q:  Still, can the switch function be supported in GDS?


  If the answer is YES, then questions
  Q: It is necessary to compile d21_cds_ref.c, but when I compiled 
     d21_cds_ref.c, the compiler reported the error of "include file
     gda_x500.h not found."

     Really, there is not gda_x500.h anywhere, and we can't continue compiling
     What should we do?

Note: There is gda_x500.h when GDS V1.0.3, but it is not used in GDS V1.1.

Thank you.

This CR has escaped notice for some time because of some missing
field values. I changed the "subcomponent" field to port_gd, but
am cancelling the bug, since the Porting Guide is not supported
anymore. Although if it's a matter of "XDS switching between GDS
and CDS not [being] provided" (see first comment above) perhaps
some other books need to be updated.

        In gdssysadm, when I use "f" then "i" to look at the directory system
        status, it tells us that the directory system not active while I can
        use "ps awux |grep gds" to see all those processes there.

        What is more, when I tried to deactivate the system, it says "Error:
        The directory system isn't active !"; Then I tried to activate the
        system, it again gave me error: "Error: The directory system is active"

        To me, the internal state is totaly messed up.

[10/20/94 public]
I can't reproduce this on either 486 or UX.  Can you provide more details
of your configuration, what baseline of code you are using, what you have
been doing with the system, et cetera.

I took a look at Weidong's machine.  It turns out that his machine did not
have the en_US.ISO8859-1 locale file built.  After making this there was no
problem.

Using BL20, I ran the gds_sec test.  It passed.  However, this is what GDS
looked like afterwards:

#       PROCTYPE    PID    DIRID    IPCID    STATE
#
        Monitor     477      -        5        -        
        DUA-Cache   496      -        1        -        
        C-Stub      438      -        2        -        

No core files found.

In the gds_sec.log file there are many messages "The requestor does not
have permission to perform the operation."  Here's an example:

  ---> Start of  dap_b1.log
  
  TEST : sec_dap_b1
  EXPECTED : anonymous bind ok
  The requestor does not have permission to perform the operation.
  EXPECTED : show protected attr failed
  EXPECTED : simple bind ok
   1) /C=re/O=sni/OU=buba/CN=one
      User-Password : \x73\x65\x63\x72\x65\x74\x31
  EXPECTED : show protected attr succeeded
  Some part of the Directory Service is not willing to perform the operation.
  EXPECTED : DCE bind failed
    
Are these errors or part of the expected results?

Note that we ran into problems with CDS early in the test:

  TET - Test Environment Toolkit for testing GDS/Admin on a local machine
  TestSuite = gds_sec

  Configure DCE using cell_name:  C=ie/O=digital
  1994-09-29-11:03:51.687-04:00I----- cdsclerk(28769) ERROR cds general clerk_bind

  Routine rpc_binding_set_auth_info(3rpc) failed : status = 336760839.
  Login to DCE ...
    
Which may be related.  Defect 10566 (CDS) has been updated and upgraded to
priority 1.

So, would you consider this a passing test?

[09/29/94 public]
First: I consider gds_sec tests as passed if the journal.log file
says: 0 FAILED. I think it's possible that gds_sec tests work even if
you get these "Routine rpc_binding_set_auth_info(3rpc) failed " problem.
(We get it here too ...)
Second: These are expected results. If there is any error or unexpected
thing you'll see UNEXPECTED or ERROR.
Third: There are no DSA's because:
gds_sec tests configure dir. id 1 as client system.
Then they configure dir. id 11 and 12 and perform the tests.
Finally they remove dir. id 11 and 12.
So only dir. id 1 is there in the end - and this client system has no DSA's.
So: cancelled.

In test/functional/directory/xds/tet_scen: the scenarios for

all

and

all_no_switch

are identical.
"all" should contain also the switch tests.

[9/1/94 public]
The difference is in how local_TET.api interprets the option.  See the case
statement at the bottom of the script.

Rich,
Below is a list of GDS Makefiles that do not have EXPDIR defined
(yet they are trying to export something).  Currently, these targets
are ending up in the install tree and are not used as part of the build.
We need you to look into this ASAP.

*** makefile error: Can't export asn1.h because EXPDIR is not defined in the Makefile.
[ /directory/gds/rtros/ros/roliby/Makefile ]

*** makefile error: Can't export libNDS.sl because EXPDIR is not defined in the Makefile.

[9/1/94 public]
I don't understand this defect.  This doesn't happen in the nightly build.
Under what circumstances did you find this?

[9/1/94 public]
As per your request (CR # 9748) to insure that missing EXPDIR from a Makefile
does not default to using IDIR; I did a build of DCE with a modified
version of osf.std.mk to weed out Makefiles that may have this problem.
You recieved a list of gds makefiles that need to be checked (and possibly
fixed).  This check in osf.std.mk has not been (and probably won't be) 
submitted to the tree, so, you won't see these error messages in the
nightly build logs.

[9/1/94 public]
It turns out that all the makefiles listed above have target specific
EXPDIR values (e.g., libxxx.a_EXPDIR).  Therefore, no fix is necessary.
Cancelled.

The gds_sec test does not check that dce_login authentication was performed
correctly.

Here's a code fragment from gds_sec_all:

  tp1() {
        tet_infoline "DCE_Security DAP tests with dce_login gds_cl1"

        gdssysadm -fd -p
        gdssysadm -fc -m4 -d11 -c2 -C16 -s2 -A25

EOT
        check_ERROR_gds_sec dap_b2.log $?

check_ERROR_gds_sec should check the return code on dce_login.

[08/25/94 public]
Rich: Please cancel this. As you see check_ERROR_gds_sec is called with two
parameters - the second one is $? which is the exit code of dce_login.

check_ERROR_gds_sec (in ts/lib/shfuncs) starts with:

if [[ $2 -ne 0 ]]
   then
#      Look for any core file in directory of execution
#      In case of a core file -> mv core core.last
       ls $TET_EXECUTE/gds_sec/core > /dev/null 2>&1
       if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]
       then
         tet_infoline "<dce_login> gave exit code: $2"
       else
         tet_infoline "<dce_login> gave exit code: $2 (core.last was dumped)"
         mv $TET_EXECUTE/gds_sec/core $TET_EXECUTE/gds_sec/core.last
       fi
       tet_infoline "FAILED "

[8/25/94 public]
Look at the code fragment again.  The return code is from the gdscp
command.  The return code on dce_login is not checked.

[8/25/94 public]
Oops, I see now that the gdscp command is executed in the sub-process
spawned by dce_login.  Cancelled.

I wonder how the gds_xds_str_001 tests can run more than 12 hours when
(see OT 11847) already the setup doesn't work correctly.
And: I don't see any chance for me to fix a core dump
in fgetc if I don't get more information.

[public]

The tests were set to run for 15 hours in the gds_xds_str_001.data file.  
As described in OT 11847, they began failing after an hour, but were still 
being run overnight.  After 12 hours, xt_test core dumped.  

The tests were being run from an HP with an OSF1 shadow.  

I'll run the tests again this weekend against BL-16.

[08/29/94 public]

I didn't see the core dump this weekend, running against BL-16.2/lgb.
So, I'll cancel this one.

The tests are still failing after a few iterations, however (CR 11847).

gdsditadm dumps core on HP if you run

gdsditadm < dsa11_init.bat.

I put the gdsditadm I used here to snihp1:/home/keutel/tmp/HP800.

(I think the gdsditadm available in predce11 will not work at all
with "Principal name" attribute because OT 11295 - type collision
for d20_dir_id.)

This gdsditadm is partly (adm/admin and adm/adm_iapl) compiled with "-g".

The core dump is in d20admin.c, line 522 (dce1.1 version).
What happens is that the DSA object re/sni/buba/dsa/dsa1 
is succesfully added to the cache.
(with ds4_b11_call_directory(1), line 515 of d20admin.c)
For an unknown reason this function call overwrites parblk - after this call
parblk = 0x0000040.
The core dump is then of course 

parblk->d20_Eenv.

If you try to read this object from the cache you get an almost
empty mask for the object name, and if you try to read it again 
gdsditadm core dumps as well.

I assume that the new attribute Principal Name is causing all the problems -
may be there is not enough memory allocated, ...

I'll send additional information via mail to Rudi and Sanjay.
I try to reproduce it on AT386. But may be it'll work - AT386
is more tolerant. (I hope it works - otherwise I couldn't understand
how it worked in Munich ...)

[07/15/94 public]
I tried to reproduce it with the last night's build - gdsditadm works
now. May be it was a link problem in my sandbox - may be it is related 
to OT 11317 (old admscheme file) -  who knows?
Anyway: gds_sec seem to work now on HP800 and AT386.

[8/2/94 public]
Can't reproduce.  Cancelled.

The GDS admin gds_sec functional tests should create the necessary cell
principals and groups as part of the test startup function.

[07/12/94 public]
They do. The corrosponding tcl files are installed
in /dcetest/dcelocal/test/tet/functional/directory/gds/ts/config.

[7/11/94 public]
There is no documentation for the GDS sec tests.  This is necessary because
this test has different configuration requirements than every other admin
test -- i.e., it configures it's own GDS namespace rather than assuming on
exists, it requires DCE be activated, and that a principal 'gds_cl1' be
created.

[7/22/94 public]
No, SNI is on the hook for the documentation.

[8/24/94 public]

Downgraded to B1, but still needs to be done for 1.1.

[10/17/94 public]
Section 7.4 of the Porting and Testing Guide now includes documentation
for the GDS Security Enhancements Tests.

[10/25/94 public]
Actually, it doesn't.  However, some architectural changes made to
local_TET.admin for OT11279 obsoleted this.  Basically, the GDS and DCE
configuration for the test environment is built into the test itself so no
external cell or directory service configuration is need. 

This defect is obsolete.  Cancelled.

NCR reports the following:

I am trying to connect a GDS client with a non-GDS server. I was able to
perform a bind and unbind request to the non-GDS sever. However, I having
to read the cell name from the global directory. It seemed that the server
rejected the request due to something to do with the country code value.  I
think the problem is that the non-GDS server does not like the coutnry code
value with T.61 syntax. It expects a printable string instead.

I discovered this by looking the trace from the trace log under
/opt/dcelocal/var/adm/directory/gds/dua, which provides apdu traces.The
following is part of the read request trace:

ENTRY: d23_attsnd



The attribute OID, syntax and value components of the country name
is as follows: 38352e342e36035553.  The 03 between the attribute OID and
country code value is the syntax code, which indicates T.61.

I finally followed the code and discovered that the x500_cvt_name_to_iapl
routine in gda_util.c set up the syntax for all attribute values to be T.61
(0x03).  However, for country name, it should be printable string instead
(0x04) according to the X.500 standard. I put in a temporary fix in the
routine for look for the OID for country name (85.4.6) and set the syntax
code to 0x04 instead. With the fix, the read request worked fine.

[06/06/94 public]
Your analysis of the problem was excellent. I have found the same problem
in the switch to CDS (gds/dua/switch) and did an equivalent fix there
(d21_cdsmis.c) some months ago.
However - the whole gda_child is no longer used. According to CR 10016
GDA has changed from calling gda_child to using the XDS interface.
If they use it correctly (means using syntax "Printable string" for
Country at the XDS/XOM interface) your problem should be solved.
(I will remove all in gds/gda (gda_child stuff) when I got the final OK from
CDS - see 10016.)

[6/23/94 public]
Cancelled because the code to which this defect refers will be defuncted
shortly.

[5/17/94 public]
No build error.  This is an artifact of a problem in CDS.  Build logs
messages are sometimes a bit disordered because of timing differences
between when stdout and stderr messages are actually written into the log.

There isn't any build problem here.  This is a re-iteration of an earlier
build problem with DTS tests.

You are only seeing this because switchlib/threads_up is the very last
directory visited in the build.

Actually, nothing is built in this directory; the files are simply
installed during the install pass.

There are format errors in the table which describes the gdssysadm
switches.

(It looks like there are vertical lines which should seperate the columns
in the table.  The lines, however, are printed serially beneath the table.

[3/15/94 public]

You looked at the "man" (i.e., nroff) version, right?  There are a lot of
problems in general with nroff versions of man pages that contain tables.
For example, most of these have to be run through a postprocessor called
col in order to make them look at all decent.  This is a problem of various
man commands, not of the doc source.

The table in question is a monster, but I don't think we're going to do
anything about it.  It looks OK when formatted for PostScript.  When you
run the nroff output through col it looks somewhat less bad, but the only
way to fix the appearance online would be to reformat the table completely.
It's just too wide to fit into 80 columns.  In fact, if you run the nroff
through col and display the output on a wide window, the table looks fine.
It should be reformatted, but it's not on anybody's agenda to do that.

[3/15/94 public]
Yep, that's what I was looking at, alright.  Nevermind ....

The test drivers found in src/test/directory/gds/script need to be built

on the user's machine along with the other GDS functional tests and test
drivers.

[05/26/94 public]
The files in src/test/directory/script should be defuncted, because
most of them had beem moved to src/test/functional/directory/xds/ts/scripts.

They already are defuncted.  These defect is obsoleted by the creation of
the new TETized functional tests.  Therefore, it is cancelled

I checked the sandbox on Orange in which this error occured.  The first
thing I noticed is that the sources were out-of-date:  11/8.  Secondly, it
has been proven that GDS builds on RIOS for the 1.0.3 release and no
changes have been made in 1.0.3a which would affect GDS. I don't believe
this error occurs.

Since no RIOS builds are currently being done for 1.0.3a I am cancelling
this defect.  If the problem reoccurs in the next RIOS 1.0.3a build with
current sources then it can be re-opened.

While cleaning up from a 48 hour run of gds_xds_str_001, I noticed that
some Dir-User processes were running on the test systems.  In examining the
output from ps, I saw that there were some xt_test programs hanging around
from Nov. 12.  The test driver, being message driven, did not clean up
these processes when they hung, which indicates that they executed all
of the specified GDS operations, and printed a "success" message to the
log file.  This is consistent with what xdb reports as being the point of
the hang (obtained on an HP via xdb -P <pid> ):

I found two of these hung processes on one machine, and one on another.  I
suspect the DUA in the xt_tester is missing some message from the C-Stub
(for instance: hey, it is okay to exit, I verified the workspace is 
shutdown, or something) that it needs to exit.  This is logged with 
a relatively low sev/prio so that it does not hold ship for 1.0.3, but this
should be looked into.

[7/11/94 public]
This should be fixed for 1.1

[8/18/94 public]
We've never been able to reproduce this with the FVTs.  We're just starting
a cycle of the system tests again now so the priority will be dropped while
we wait to reproduce the problem.  Of course, if it's not reproduced this
defect will be cancelled.

[9/30/94 public]
We haven't seen this in a very long time, so I'm cancelling this.

The tag LIBS must be replaced by gdsditadm_LIBS, resp. gdscacheadm_LIBS
in the specified Makefiles. Otherwise, the libraries are not taken
during linking.

[11/11/93 public]
Howard Melman was right. This was a stupid error in the SNI Munich common
makefile. Therefore canceled.

The following testcases require a different GDS configuration than the one
described in the porting guide:

add_entry1tv
compare1tv
list1tv
mod_entry1tv
read1tv
remove1tv

Therefore, these testcases are not run be default.  There should be an
additional description of how to configure GDS for these tests and
instructions on how to run them.

[11/12/93 public]

Assigned this CR to Doug Weir.

[10/17/94 public]
Done; should be updated by Doug Weir.

[10/25/94 public]
Actually, the conversion of the switch tests to run under TET obsoletes
this OT.  Cancelled.

[11/4/93 public]
I want to submit a new version of ROS (2.5a), that will be used by DME.
The files will be in a separate directory, so they won't interfere with
the DCE ROS files.

Rich, I don't know, if it is allowed to submit these files to the
dce1.0.3 backing build, because they should belong to an unintegrated
OSF dce1.0.3 delivery.
If not, please tell me how I can send the files to you.

[11/11/93 public]
Two compressed tar files had been copied to the /afs/dce/project/dce/sni
directory: rosdme.tar.Z and rosdmetest.tar.Z .
The contents of these tar files should be integrated into the nosupport
area of DCE1.0.3 by OSF.

Delivery was necessary, because DME is using a specific management
profile ( AOM 12 ) for CMIP, that is not supported in the official
DCE1.0.3 ROS delivery.
For DCE1.1, a combined version will be delivered.

[11/12/93 public]
SNI wasn't ready to submit the code before the 1.0.3 freeze so it will be
incorporated into the 1.0.3 by tarring a copy into the source tree.  Since
this does not represent any change in the DCE source tree this defect is
cancelled.

Talked to Rich Zeliff about this. There was no time to get this

The 'valid' test mod_rdn7v reports an error:

:       name = name82
:       call ds_remove_entry()

:       REMOVE_ENTRY returned ERROR


This occurs on both 486 and UX, running the test as both local and remote.

[11/4/93 public]
Canceled because of the following argumentation of Chris Costello:
Non-threaded testcases in general use build_tree*
and delete_tree* to construct and destroy the
environment for the testcase proper. The outcome
of the testcase is not dependent on their success
or failure, hence the message
        : Testcase mod_rdn7v passed
which reflects the outcome of the MODIFY_RDN call.
Failures in build_tree or delete_tree may be ignored.

Although the libNDS library builds & installs during the build of DCE,
it doesn't install (in /opt/dcelocal) during installation & configuration
of a DCE cell.

[11/2/93 public]
That's because you aren't installing GDS as part of the daily smoketesting.

gdsstub and gdscstubs are dying with the following error message:
   d25raction.c(154): FATAL ERROR: ROS-function failed.

A DCE cell and GDS had been configured for the DUA switch tests on an HP/UX
machine. Both DCE and GDS were brought down and a fresh set of binaries
where installed.  Configuration for both DCE and GDS were preserved.  DCE
cell was restarted.  GDS was activated.  The Sstub died immediately.

Logs will be placed in the AFS cell.

[11/1/93 public]
Logs are in /afs/dce/project/dce/sni/OT9298

[11/1/93 public]
Just went through a cycle of ten activation/de-activations of GDS.  8 times
the gdssstub died, and twice the gdscstub died.  Cstub log contained the
same error message identified above.

Tracing was not turned on.

[11/1/93 public]
Forgot to mention:  latest cycle of testing was done on a fresh set of
binaries (built 10/30) and a fresh configuration.  Reminants of old
configuration were removed.

[zeliff 11/1/93 public] 
There is some evidence that the failure was caused by user error during the
initialization of GDS.  However, if this was the case then why did the
problem re-occur after the re-install which removed the reminants of the
old configuration?  (This was done by answering 'y' to the dce_config
prompt which provides this service.)

In any case, I physically removed the old dcelocal directory (rm -rf is
your friend) and reinstalled everything from scratch.  Problem no longer
occurs. 

Will leave this open for another couple of days.  If it doesn't reoccur I
will cancel it.

[11/2/93 public]
Cancelled and dce.rm defect 9314 opened.

On Friday I configured a DCE and GDS cell on an HP for the running of the
DUA Switch tests.  I did not, however, run the tests but simply left the
cell in place over the weekend.  On Monday morning I discovered the S-stub
had disappeared.

I've logged this bug against all platforms because I have seen evidence of
similar problems on other platforms.

Date of the gdssstub binary is from nightly build of 10/28.

[11/3/93 public]
Could not reproduce.  Cancelled.  Believed to have been caused by bad cache
initialization.

when running the threads_up xds tests on HPUX, with DSA-M1 on the tester
UX machine, and DSA-M2 on AIX, many threads fail many tests, or
not diffently, with DS-status differ messages. 
I will put an XDS, DSA and LOG out into the dce cell at
/afs/dce/project/dce/sni/OTxxxx, where xxxx is  the OT number assigned to
this report.  NOTE THAT THEY WILL NOT match the enclosed log, since it
fails differently each time one runs it.

Here's a log frag:

The success of the thread_up tests is NOT guaranteed (up stands for
unpredictable). The reason for the existence of these tests is to test,
if they will crash the directory service processes, and is not test of
the proper functionality.
OSF should have a description of this in the latest porting and testing
guide. Anyway, Rudi Wildgruber will check, if the guide has to be updated
and will make a copy available.

[10/22/93 public]
Ohhh, it's _supposed_ to work that way.  Kind of an _odd_ test . . .
Cancelled.

When running the threads_os tests on an HPUX, with DSA-M1 on HPUX and
DSA-M2 on AIX, using the script:

# touch $D2_LOG_DIR/threads_os.log
# foreach i (`ls T*`)
? ../../xt_test -t $i >> threads_os.log
? end
#

too many threads pass on what appears to be ALL of the tests -- only one thread
per test is supposed to pass.  Each time the test is run, different
threads pass/fail differently.  I enclose a log frag from one of the test 
runs; an XDS log, dua log, and dsa log will be put in the cell at
/afs/dce/project/dce/sni/OTxxxx, where xxxx is whatever OT number gets
assigned to this report.  NOTE THAT THEY WILL NOT MATCH THIS LOG, since
they were generated by an earlier run.

Changed description, above.  Too many tests are PASSING.  Test was between
HPUX and AIX, not 486.  Sorry about the confusion -- you see
what it's like keeping all 4 reference platforms straight in one's head   .
. . note multiple bodies passing, above . . .

[10/26/93 public]


More data:  seems as between HPUX and 486, ON BOTH MACHINES, no thread
running BODYadd_entry20v ever passes, and in fact the shutdown fails too.
THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME between HPUX and 486 (hot dog!).
I've put logs into /afs/dce/project/dce/sni/OT9231/add_entry20v*.

And here's the xt_test.log:

# cd xds/tests.xds/threads_os
# ../../xt_test -d -t T10add_entry20v >> $D2_LOG_DIR/add_entry20v.xdslog

The gdssysadm 'save' operation does not work to 'file' on HP/UX.  It
instead writes a bunch of 'echo' commands:

echo 1t3072t./var/directory/gds/dir1/attr24.idx >>
./var/adm/directory/gds/tmp/vol1.1;

to the screen and prints the 'Error: the selection function can't be
executed!' message.

How to reproduce:

1. Configure gds as a basic client-server system, accept all other defaults
2. activate gds
3. Modify t.cache/t.cacheinit2 as you would for the admin tests
4. configure directory1 using cacheinit2 and gdsditadm
5. In gdssysadm, select 'save' with the following options:

	directory: 1
	medium:    file
	name:	   dir1
	password:  <return>

[10/25/93 public]
Able to reproduce consistently on one machine but cannot reproduce on
another.  Dropping to B2 until an explanation of problem is found.  This
will not be considered a ship hold.

[10/25/93 public]
Oops, cancelled by mistake.

More data:
This problem does not occur when telnetting to the victim machine.  It only
seems to occur when logged on to the console.  The environment is HPVue,
using xterms. It occurs with TERM=vt100 and TERM=xterm.

Changing priority to 1 and will be considered a shiphold.

[10/25/93 public]
Problem is with the 'date' command spitting out garbage.  E.g.:

	Mon Oct 25 14:15:37 EDT" 1993

This was caused by a mangled value of TZ in /etc/src.sh on my machine.
Apparently, this file is read when logging onto the console, but is not
read when establishing a logon environment when telnetting in or rloging
in.

We seem to fall into an infinite loop when lexing ndscomp.l on my HP,
prague.  This does not happen on our nightly build machine, zagreb. 

How to reproduce:

- Log into prague as me
- Do a workon to the sandbox 'ndscomp'
	workon -sb ndscomp
- cd directory/gds/nds
- type: 'build ndscomp'

You probably want to push it into the background.

If you set your window to vt100 emulation, you can invoke the 'top' command
and watch lex eat ~95% of the cpu.

[10/22/93 public]
We found, that it takes on some systems - depending on the hardware and
system load - very long to run the lex.
I heard, that someone found the lex had run over an hour. 
Rich, please check, that it is a very slow running lex.

[10/22/93 public]
Verified that it takes 10 minutes to lex this file on an unloaded HP710.
Although this seems excessive I will cancel.  Abby O'Hara can reopen this
if she thinks the lex time on Sinix is unacceptable.

The steps to reproduce this are documented in chapter 5 of the porting
guide.  They are:

 - configured and activate GDS (client-server, all other defaults
	accepted.) 
 - modified the following files:
	gemini:/usr/sandbox/tst/
		t.cache:
			t.cacheinit1	
			t.3cacheinit1	
			t.4cacheinit1	
		t.dsa
			t8.dsa1		
			t8.dsa2		
	Machines:
		m1 - 130.105.5.83 (gemini/OSF1)
		m2 - 130.105.5.41 (prague/UX)

 - configured directory 1 using t.cacheinit1
	(results stored in gemini:/usr/sandbox/test_results/m1.cacheinit1)

 - attempted to configure directories 3 and 4
	results stored in gemini:/usr/sandbox/test_results
		m1.3cacheinit1
		m1.4cacheinit1

All initialization scripts and GDS binaires were installed on gemini from
the nightly build of 10/20.  Scripts were installed using dcetest_config.

directory/gds/ros/Seplog/Makefile should not define EXPLIB_SUBDIRS when
LIBDCE_LIBRARY_MAKEFILE is defined.

[10/5/93 public]

Well, it's really a problem in libdce/Makefile. Since
directory/gds/ros/Seplog/Makefile has been changed, the following fragment
in libdce/Makefile should be fixed to visit either
directory/gds/ros/Seplog/lib or directory/gds/ros/Seplog/lib_r.

# libslog.a files
LIBDCE_CURR_INCDIR = directory/gds/ros/Seplog
.if exists(${DIRECTORY_GDSMKPATH}/gds.mk)
.include <${DIRECTORY_GDSMKPATH}/gds.mk>
.endif
.include <${MAKETOP}/directory/gds/ros/Seplog/Makefile>
EXP_libslog_OFILES := ${libslog_OFILES}

[10/5/93 public]

More..! Same for directory/gds/dua/Makefile.

[10/5/93 public]

These also need to be fixed.

libdce_6.a_OFILES =             \
        ${EXP_libslog_OFILES:S;^;../directory/gds/ros/Seplog/;g}	\
        ${EXP_libdua_OFILES:S;^;../directory/gds/dua/;g}	\

	${EXP_libdua_OFILES:S;^;../directory/gds/dua/;g}

[10/5/93 public]

I now have the latest libdce/Makefile. Cancelling this.

Full Description:

	Nick and I just spent two hours trying to debug why latest 1.0.3
gdssysadm dumps core when running on a RIOS machine. It turns out that the
machine has 1.0.2 gds message catalog files installed.

	In other cases, we have seen other message incompatibility
problems.

	It looks like that 1.0.3 gds re-designed message catalog files,
incompatible with 1.0.2 files. One example is using "dspcat gdssysadm.cat 1 1"
on RISO machine to see the different mesaages with 1.0.2 and 1.0.3.

	It is probably too late to say that 1.0.3 should try to make those
message catalog files compatible by adding new sets to the files for new
messages. Assuming that the redesign is a must, I would like to see a check
implemented which will tell me when I am using a wrong version of message
file. 


Proposed Solution:

	Make 1.0.3 gds executable be able to tell if message catalog files are
1.0.2 based. In that case, give an error and quit. "gdssysadm.cat 1 1" is
one example to check for 1.0.2 or 1.0.3.

[10/15/93 public]

Sorry guys, but 1.0.2 cat files go with 1.0.2 executables, and 1.0.3 cat
files go with 1.0.3.  Cancelled.

[10/18/93 public]

On a system where both 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 GDS are available, it is likely that
crossing using will happen. A simple check should help.

There is another side effect due to the way 1.0.3 GDS uses its catalog
file. One particular message cannot be longer than certain length (I belive
that it is "gdssysadm.cat 1 1", where it is a number for 1.0.3, and a long
string for 1.0.2), otherwise it causes core dump (the code allocates an
arrary of "enough" byte to hold this number. The array is on the stack,
followed by a pointer pointing to the starting address of the array. When a
longer message is read, there is no check to insure that it does not go
beyond the bound of the array. When that happens, the next pointer is
corrupted, causing core dump). 

If someone changes the catalog file, in particular that piece of the
message, the GDS will not work any more.

Section 5.4 of the Porting & Testing Guide describes all of the GDS tests
except for the ROS tests.

[09/07/93 public]

Assigned bug to Doug Weir (OSF Porting Guide book owner)
and added Rich Nollman (SNI GDS writer) to interest list.

[09/22/93 public]
Dave Treff explained that there is no ROS test documentation
because the tests were never ported to either the AIX or the
pmax platforms. However, one of the 1.0.3 deliverables is a
"brand-new ROS implementation, with tests", and he says there
should be documentation with this. He expects it to arrive
"in a month or so" (this was on 7 September, so that means in
early October).

[11/7/93 public]
Fixed. This information was part of the updates from SNI which
arrived recently, and this has all been incorporated into Chapter 5.

[11/7/93 public]
Unfortunately this isn't quite done yet.  The documentation we received for
1.0.3 isn't really an adequate description of the matter.  The key thing
that is missing is a description of the GDS configuration required (if any)
to run the tests.

Since we're getting Yet Another New ROS in DCE1.1 we can defer this until
then.

[05/25/94 public]
There is no seperate RTROS test for the new RTROS. Old ROS is defuncted.
RTROS is tested implicitly by gds.
That's the SNI way to fix bugs.

[6/20/94 public]
Defect cancelled.

[1/5/94 public]
Sigh.  It would be nice to have details about the problem. 

I've confirmed that NO_GDS does work on HP800 and OSF1.  I'm looking for a
spare RIOS to test this on now.

[4/6/94 public]
Cancelled.  I think cjd was confused because there are GDS APIs built into
libdce even though NO_GDS is set.

Full Description:

	I was trying to do some client server communication between 1.0.1 GDS
	(my Sparc port) and 1.0.2 GDS (AIX ref port, 1.0.2a_b2 build).

	When I tried to connect 1.0.2 GDS to my 1.0.1 DSA running on my Sparc,
	I got warning/error saying "Couldn't read schema", but it did connect
	to the DSA, then when I tried to read attributes of an entry by
	specifying the necessary items, I got "No connection to DSA/DUA" error.
	Checking on the 1.0.1 GDS on Sparc, I foudn the S-stub process was 
	gone.
	
	Going from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 DSA is OK.


Proposed Solution:

	This could be the problem of my 1.0.1 GDS Sparc port. But I was not
	able to find a reference 1.0.1 port to test it.

[9/21/93 public]


I am not sure whether this is  a porting problem or a real
problem in GDS 1.0.1. I have no version of GDS1.0.1 and I
don't want to fix bugs in GDS1.0.1 which are already fixed in GDS 1.0.3.
I don't know what you have done but there was some excepted 
incompatible changes in the protocol between 1.0.1 and 1.0.3
(e.g. for some conformance issues).
I don't think that this is a prior 1 bug and atleast we should close
it or downgrade it.

There seem to be several interoperability problems between Siemen's GDS
and DEC's X.500. These problems were found on mips-OSF/1, but I
will soon verify whether or not they occur on AIX as well.

Here is a description of the current level of understanding of the problems.

The (cstub) trace shows it getting a user request and converting it to
ASN.1. This request is basically a 'SHOW ENTRY /CN=SCHEMA attributes
...'.  The request appears to be encoded correctly, but is embedded in
some other data, which I cant understand.  I think the DUA is
detecting an internal error and aborting the connection.  I believe
the reason that it works Siemans DUA to Siemans DSA is that they use a
private transfer syntax, so the request never has to be encoded as a
real X.500 message.  (The bind request indicates an alternate syntax,
we only support ASN.1).

The relevant bit of the log file follows

         R_UNKNOWN        (no_ros)                                07:41:58

DEC's DSA normally includes a calling-AP-title in bind requests and a
responding-AP-title in bind responses.  The SNI DUA doesn't seem to like the
responding-AP-title.

There is another problem, though who is at fault is not clear.  SNI does not
include a Direct-reference OID in either the bind request or bind response.
DEC's software expects one to be present.

This is a strange defect, if it is a defect at all.

The gdsshd system test setup tries to do the following:

  - configure an initial DSA,
  - add a few other DSA's to the cache
  - Add the initial country, org, org unit, "dsa" and dsa-name to the DSA.
  - configure another DSA
  - change the master knowledge of the other DSA to be owned by the
    initial DSA
  - copy the DIT from the inital DSA to the root of the other DSA
  - Add the other DSA to the DIT.

When I do any of the create or copy operations, I use the following to 
specify the directory id, operation, and DSA

gdsditadm -i<dir_id> -o<operation> -d<DSA-dn> << EOF

followed by the batch file.  This works for all operations except the creation
of the intial DSA object.  In this case, the log file shows no errors, but
a request to show objects for /us/osf/dce/*/*, Object Type: * shows only
the other DSA, not the initial DSA.  If the batch file is run again, the
log file shows the error "Object already exists".  If I change the batch
file to remove the object (which the log says exists, but which I can't 
see via gdsditadm!), and run the modified script twice, the log from the
first run shows no error, but the log from the second run says "Object
does not exist!".  I am flabbergasted.  Is GDS maintaining some alternate
DIB to which I have no access?

As a workaround, I modified the script so that the dir id and operation are
specified in the batch file as opposed to the gdsditadm command line.

My questions are as follows:
   1) Is it not legal to use these options whe running gdsditadm with a
      batch file?
   
   2) If so, why does it work in all of the cases described above except
      for one?

   3) If not, why, and where is it stated in the documentation? This used
      to work (in DCE 1.0.1).

We've seen this problem before and we've even opened defects against it,
but (if I remember correctly) we've had problems reproducing it.  Well,
here it is again:

This occured when building in a fully populated sandbox in which the obj
tree was provided via an NFS mount.

[ -f $i/libdce.so ]; then  break;  fi  done;  rm -f attr*.* obje

gendb aborted

[2/1/93 public]
This was originally an A0 because it broke a nightly build.  Since there's
a workaround (don't run these programs across a hard mount), we're
downgrading it to C2.

[2/17/93 public]
I can add some more information to the defect since we've run up against
this once again.

Here are the current list of symptoms:
	
			Mounted 
OS of Build		Filesystem		Result

RIOS			RIOS			works, go figure
RIOS			PMAX, hard mount	gdsmkiss hangs
						(for hours, 8 in
						this case)
RIOS			PMAX, soft mount	gdsmkiss returns
                                                an error 2.

[3/23/93 public]
hmm.  Downgraded to 3, deferred till 1.0.3.

[4/5/93 public]

I had the same problem a while ago when trying to build a sandbox on my
Sparc with obj mounted from a RIOS. gksmkiss hung there forever. I didn't
l=know what was going on, but got around it by cleaning up local disk and
had obj local.

Later I got a hanging problem again when doing threads testing. On test
(cuvb_nbi_005) tests fcntl (cma_fcntl). On thing it does is to create a 
write lock (F_WRLCK) for the file. When I ran  this
test, it failed by hanging there forever (could not be killed either).
Using debugger I found that it happens with the call to create the write
lock. It never returns. At first I thought that Sun may not sopport write
lock, or Sun's write lock is buggy. It turns out that it is because of nfs
(I mount another disk from another machine). When a lock is created, it
goes through the lockd. If the file is nfs mounted, the local lockd will
talk to the remote lockd, which will talk to statd for status monitoring.
If any one of the lockd or statd is not running, the process is waiting
forever. The machine I mount the disk did not run lockd and statd.

So, since gksmkiss uses fil lock too, I suspected that it was the same
cause. The RIOS I was using did not run lockd and statd by default, so I
started them and I was able to do nfs mount build.

Another thing I learned is that OSF/1 does not have lockd and statd, which
makes it impossible to nfs mount from a OSF/1 machine and do the build.

[10/7/93 public]
This is a problem with OSF's implementation of NFS and therefore isn't a
defect in GDS.  Cancelled.

        Both osf/1 and aix define size_t in <stdio.h>, so those files
        can be compiled without error. But on Sun, size_t is NOT defined
        in <stdio.h>. Instead, itis defined in <stddef.h>. This causes the 
        failure of compilation of those files: size_t is not defined.

Proposed Solution:

        <stddef.h> should be also included. Definition of size_t in
        <stddef.h> on both osf/1 and aix comes with #ifdef SIZE_T, so it is
        not a problem and redefinition.

This works on AIX ,PMAX, and SVR4. Idon't want to change this now.
We can decide for Code cleanup what should be changed.

[3/23/93 public]
Agree with Helmut, deferred until 1.1

[1/17/94 public]
I want to cancel this, because site_t is set on POSIX compliant systems
in <stdio.h> Ports to non-POSIX systems should fix it according to their
policy.
Do you agree, Rich?

[1/31/94 public]
Agreed.

        Both osf/1 and aix define SEEK_SET in <stdio.h>, but not every
        system does it the same. Sun defines it in <unistd.h>.

Proposed Solution:

        Add include of <unistd.h> to those files. This will not create a 
        compiler redefintion problem for osf/1 and aix since the defintion 
        of SEEK_SET in <unistd.h> on osf/1 and aix comes with #ifdef.

Yet one more file: security/krb5/lib/keytab/file/ktf_util.c

include <unistd.h>.

[1/17/94 public]
According to POSIX and XPG3, SEKK_SET should be set in <stdio.h>.
People who port to non-POSIX systems should set it in their
environment.
So I want to cancel this bug. Do you agree, Rich?

[1/31/94 public]

Full Description:

  Perform a read on an object with an empty acl using ds_read.
  What is returned by XDS for the acl follows:

     ACL
       1 Modify Public ACL item
          DSX_Interpretation = DSX_ROOT_OF_SUBTREE
          DSX_User - Only composed of the DS_C_DS_DN object class oid
       1 Read Standard ACL item
          DSX_Interpretation = DSX_ROOT_OF_SUBTREE
          DSX_User - Only composed of the DS_C_DS_DN object class oid
       1 Modify Standard ACL item
          DSX_Interpretation = DSX_ROOT_OF_SUBTREE
          DSX_User - Only composed of the DS_C_DS_DN object class oid
       1 Read Sensitive ACL item
          DSX_Interpretation = DSX_ROOT_OF_SUBTREE
          DSX_User - Only composed of the DS_C_DS_DN object class oid
       1 Modify Sensitive ACL item
          DSX_Interpretation = DSX_ROOT_OF_SUBTREE
          DSX_User - Only composed of the DS_C_DS_DN object class oid


  The acl should contain no acl items.

Repeat By:

  Perform a ds_read on an object with an empty acl, with the
  selection parameter set to DS_SELECT_ALL_TYPES_AND_VALUES.
  The acl returned will match the above description.

Proposed Solution:

  When an empty acl is read there should be no DSX_C_GDS_ACL_ITEM
  returned.  Location of proposed fix ... ??

[12/08/92 public]
I have given a long explanation over e-mail to
this problem and I think the bug should be canceled.

[2/23/93 public]
Assigned to Norbert.

[3/22/93 public]
Deferred until 1.0.3.

[10/7/93 public]
Defect aging time-out.  Priority bumped to 1.

[10/15/93 public]

hey Helmut, could you give a briefer but no less explanatory note
in this report as to why we should cancel it?

[10/20/93 public]
Deferred to 1.1.

[01/31/94 public]
In GDS you can not have an object without ACL, that means
every single Object have a AACL. At least this ACL can
be the whole subtree below root (what is the current ACL 
showing in the example above). So in every object there is a mandatory 
Attribute for the ACL and you can not remove it.

[01/31/94 public]
My message above means that this is no bug.
If you do a ds_read over XDS and request for 
DS_SELECT_ALL_TYPES_AND_VALUES, you everytime get a
ACL back, that means you everytime get acl items back.
In the XDS/XOM manual is a chapter Access Control is a sentence
The directory attribute DSX_A_ACL is present for each entry in the
DIT. This means implicit that if you read DS_SELECT_ALL_TYPES_AND_VALUES
and if you set PREF_ADM_FUNC you get an ACL back. If you make a
standard ds_read you will not get an ACL Attribute back.
This is no bug , it should be cancelled.

[2/16/94 public]
But the point of the defect was that no ACLs were specified for the object
but ACLs were returned.

[01/31/94 public]
Please close this bug.
I only want to say above, there exist no entry without ACL,
and if you read with DS_ALL_TYPES_AND_VALUES and PREFER_ADM_FUNC you
everytime get an ACL back like you get it on UNIX by an ls -l.
If you make a normal read without PREFER_ADM_FUNC you don't get an ACL
back. There exist no empty ACL attribute in GDS, atleast there exist
an ACL what say everybody below ROOT can read and modify, but it exists.

[01/31/94 public]
 there exist no entry without ACL means that there is an inheritance in GDS
in the form that if you create an entry without ACL it automatically gets
the ACL of the superior entry. That means there really exist no entry 
without ACL.

Either due to lack of instructions or because of incorrect files, we have not yet
run the ROS test bucket successfully.

Logs have been sent earlier as mail notes.

[12/06/91 public]
This defect has been marked 'deferred' (do not fix in 1.0) by the DRBoard.  Reason:
Not required to meet DCE 1.0 Ship Criteria.

[01/14/93 public]
Reassigned to me.

[2/2/93 public]
Deferred to 1.0.3, when we'll actually need it fixed.  Remains a C1

[12/22/93 public]
Reassigned to me.

[3/21/93 public]
ROS is gone. It will be replaced by RTROS. Because of that the old
ros tester is no longer meaningful and will be defuncted.
So this OT should be closed. Rich?

[3/21/94 public]
After the drop, yes.  (Cancelled, actually.)

[3/29/94 public]
Tests defuncted along with 'ros' itself.  GDS switched to RTROS, instead.

Well, that's one way to fix a defect.
