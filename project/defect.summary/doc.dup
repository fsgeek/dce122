The man pages for dce_acl_is_client_authorized and
dce_acl_inq_client_permset are missing two parameters, own_id
and grp_id, which should follow the acl_uuid.

One of our developers reports that the man page for clearinghouse has the
wrong names for the counters.

%man clearinghouse 
.
.
.
COUNTERS
     The clearinghouse counters are:
 
     badchs    Specifies the number of  times  the  clearinghouse
               entry missing event was generated.
 
     baddata   Specifies the number of times that the data  corr-
               uption event was generated.
 
     badskulks Specifies the number of times that a  skulk  of  a
               directory,   initiated  from  this  clearinghouse,
               failed to complete- usually  because  one  of  the
               replicas in the replica set was unreachable.
 
     badupgrades
               Specifies  the  number  of  times  that   upgrades
               failed.
 
     disables  Specifies the number of times that  the  clearing-
               house was disabled since it was last started.
 
     enables   Specifies the number of times that  the  clearing-
               house was enabled since it was last started.
 
     partials  Specifies the number of requests directed to  this
               clearinghouse  that  resulted  in  the return of a
               partial answer instead of satisfying the  client's
               request.
 
     reads     Specifies the number of read  operations  directed
               to this clearinghouse.
 
 
     writes    Specifies the number of write operations  directed
               to this clearinghouse.


In reality:

        badchs -> missingentries
        baddata -> corruptions
        badskulks -> skulkfailures
        badupgrades -> failedupgrades
        partials -> returnedrefs
        rootlosts -> rootunreachables

OT 13323 was closed with the note:
"All 'time' related attributes are no longer specified as 'hours',
but rather 'relative_time', talking about DTS relative time format,
including the syntax.  As of 1.2, there is no confusion with these
attributes."
But in looking at the source file for the registry manpage, the syntax
description of the maxtktlife attribute still describes it as taking
"hours" as a parameter rather than "relative_time."  The description
prose describes maxtktlife as using relative time, so I'm sure this
was just an oversight in editing, but the syntax should be made to
match the prose descrition to avoid confusion.
Added field Transarc Deltas with value `15667'

[4/2/96 public]
Sigh.  This is the code from dcecp_registry.8dce, dropped to OSF on
10/95...

.LI "\*Lmaxtktlife \*Vrelative_time\*O"
This registrywide account policy defines the maximum amount of time
that a ticket can be valid.
Specify the time using the DTS relative time format (\*V[-]DD-hh:mm:ss\*O).
When a client requests a ticket to
a server, the lifetime granted to the ticket takes into registry the
\*Lmaxtktlife\*O set for both the server and the client.  In other
words, the lifetime cannot exceed the shorter of the server's or
client's \*Lmaxtktlife\*O.  If you do not specify a \*Lmaxtktlife\*O
for a registry, the \*Lmaxtktlife\*O defined as registry authorization
policy is used.

I don't know why the file in the OSF tree does not reflect this, but
it IS done.  HP will do a second manpage drop soon, and I've double-checked
to make sure this is STILL in our version of the manpage.  In the mean
time, I'm considering this a dup of 13377.

[4/2/96 public]
Jim is correct. I am the guilty party who did the work, and I
just checked my copy of the file as received, which reads just
as given above. It came in correct, and I sent it out incorrect.
Either I missed the parameter name change or (more likely) in-
correctly understood the issue.

"clearinghouse show" can take an option of "-attribute", indicating that
clearinghouse attributes should be returned.

clearinghouse help show shows this option. But the Command Ref for this
subcommand does not mention this option.

It is also important to point out that this option does not return any
specific attribute. To do so, the user can use "attrlist" command.

[3/25/96 public]

The clearinghouse manpage (command_ref) is fine, but there are a
number of bad examples of 'clearinghouse show -attribute' in the
admin guide.  Please fix these.

[3/26/96 public]

This is a duplicate of ot13326, which points out the same 'clearinghouse
show' command examples.  I added the text from this ot into 13226 so that
the points about stressing what the '-attribute' option does and the use
of 'attrlist' will not be lost.

Following is a list of various defects found in the utc.8dce
manpage by Maria Wadlow at Transarc and communicated to us here
at OSF. These defects are in the course of being fixed at this
moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially
register the changes...

0318		typo	ComRef	1-263	man8dce/utc.8dce

	"...if present, indicates the offset from UTC and implies
	local system time.  The inacuracy commonent..."
	"inaccuracy" is misspelled and none of this text should be

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0319		style	ComRef	1-264	man8dce/utc.8dce	(x4)

	"...returns a `-1' if the first is earlier, `1' if..."
	The values in single quotes should actually be bold, according
	to the style.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0320		typo	ComRef	1-265	man8dce/utc.8dce

	"Multiplys a relative time..."
	"Multiplies" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0089            form    ComRef  
				1-264	man8dce/utc.8dce

        In the "cell backup" command description, steps 1 and 3 each
        contain a dcecp example that is too long to fit on one line.
        In dcecp commands, if you type a \ (backslash) at the end of a
        line, dcecp will continue the command on the next line with a
        ">" prompt.  In step 1, the ">" appears in the middle of the
        second line of the command and in step 3 it doesn't appear at
        all.  These examples should be fixed such that if a user types
        exactly what appears in the examples (including the
        backslash), the right thing will happen.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0128            style   ComRef  1-91    man8dce/dcecp.8dce
					and elsewhere

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

Following is a list of various defects found in the server.8dce
manpage by Maria Wadlow at Transarc and communicated to us here
at OSF. These defects are in the course of being fixed at this
moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially
register the changes...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0299		typo	ComRef	1-245	man8dce/server.8dce

	"...about which you want to see help information"
	The . (period) is missing from the end of this sentence.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0300		typo	ComRef	1-245	man8dce/server.8dce

	"prerequesites uuid_list"
	"prerequisites" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0301		tech	ComRef	1-247	man8dce/server.8dce

	"You must have i permission..."
	You actually need r permission to use the "server catalog"
	command.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0302		tech	ComRef	1-247	man8dce/server.8dce

	"server catalog /.:/hosts/foster/config"
	The correct command is: "server catalog /.:/hosts/foster"
	and the output should be:
	/.:/hosts/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver not
	/.:/hosts/foster/config/try_tserver.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0303		tech	ComRef	1-248	man8dce/server.8dce

	"server create /.:/hosts/foster/config/try_tserver \"
	The correct command is:
	"server create /.:/hosts/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver \"
	and the output is incorrect, the "{flags {}}" line shouldn't
	be there and the "-starton" line should have braces in it,
	"-starton {boot auto explicit failure}"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0304		tech	ComRef	1-248	man8dce/server.8dce

	"You must have d permission..."
	You also need r permission to use the "server delete" command.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0305		tech	ComRef	1-248	man8dce/server.8dce

	"server delete /.:/foster/config/try_tserver"
	The correct command is:
	"server delete /.:/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0306		tech	ComRef	1-249	man8dce/server.8dce	(x4)

	The "-interface" option is not optional.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0307		tech	ComRef	1-249	man8dce/server.8dce

	"You must have w permission to the server configuration
	object."
	Actually, you need w permission to the server execution
	object.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0308		tech	ComRef	1-249	man8dce/server.8dce

	"server disable /.:/foster/config/try_tserver"
	The correct command is:
	"server disable /.:/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0309		tech	ComRef	1-249	man8dce/server.8dce

	"...a list of one or more RPC interfaces to be disabled."
	This is the "server enable" command.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0310		tech	ComRef	1-249	man8dce/server.8dce

	"server enable /.:/foster/config/try_tserver"
	The correct command is:
	"server enable /.:/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0311		tech	ComRef	1-249	man8dce/server.8dce

	"server modify /.:/foster/config/try_tserver \"
	The correct command is:
	"server modify /.:/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver \"
	Also, this is a bogus example because it shows the
	"-arguments" attribute being modified, but the "-arguments"
	attribute can not be modified after creation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0312		tech	ComRef	1-252	man8dce/server.8dce
				1-253	man8dce/server.8dce	(x2)

	"You must have r permission to the applicable...object."
	You also need r permission to the corresponding container
	object.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0313		tech	ComRef	1-252	man8dce/server.8dce

	"server show /.:/foster/config/try_tserver"
	The correct command is:
	"server show /.:/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0314		typo	ComRef	1-253	man8dce/server.8dce

	"You must have (e)x permission..."
	This does not follow any convention seen to this point for
	displaying permissions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0315		tech	ComRef	1-253	man8dce/server.8dce

	"server start /.:/foster/config/try_tserver"
	The correct command is:
	"server start /.:/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0316		tech	ComRef	1-253	man8dce/server.8dce

	"server stop /.:/foster/config/try_tserver"
	The correct command is:
	"server stop /.:/foster/config/srvrconf/try_tserver"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0025            form    ComRef  
				1-249	man8dce/server.8dce
				1-252	man8dce/server.8dce

        A - (dash) is separated from the option name by a newline in
        the output.  In troff, this can be prevented by inserting a \
        (backslash) before the - (dash), which prevents the word from
        being broken over a newline.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0122            style	ComRef	
				1-245	man8dce/server.8dce	(x2)
				1-246	man8dce/server.8dce

        "UUID's" should be "UUIDs" -- plural, not possessive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0235		tech	ComRef	
				1-244	man8dce/server.8dce

	The "-types" option is missing from the "organization modify,"
	"principal modify," and "server modify" commands.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0246		style	ComRef	
				1-244	man8dce/server.8dce
				1-246	man8dce/server.8dce

	"Returns only the ERA's..."
        "ERAs" should be plural, not possessive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0128            style   ComRef  1-91    man8dce/dcecp.8dce
					and elsewhere

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

	The "registry_replica_name" argument of the "registry disable"
	command is optional and should be shown as optional in the
	synopsis.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The "registry_replica_name" argument contents would be easier
	to understand if the description included examples:

	- global name of replica (/.:/subsys/dce/sec/master)
	- replica name (subsys/dce/sec/zebra_slave)

	The "registry connect" option descriptions could be made
	clearer.  For example:
          -group local_group_name
                    Specifies the group for the local account that is
                    being created.

          -org local_org_name
                    Specifies the organization for the local account
                    that is being created.

          -mypwd local_password
                    Specifies the password for the administrator in
                    the local cell.  This administrator must have
                    permission to create accounts.

          -fgroup foreign_group_name
                    Specifies the group for the foreign account that
                    is being created.

          -forg foreign_org_name
                    Specifies the organization for the foreign account
                    that is being created.

          -facct foreign_account_name
                    Specifies the name for the administrator in the
                    foreign cell who has permission to create
                    accounts.

          -facctpwd foreign_account_password
                    Specifies the password for the administrator in
                    the foreign cell.  This administrator must have
                    permission to create accounts in the foreign cell.

          -expdate account_expiration_date
                    Optionally sets an expiration date for both local
                    and foreign accounts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0267		tech	ComRef	1-210	man8dce/registry.8dce

	"The registry connect operation creates an account in the
	local cell for the specified foreign cell and also creates an
	account in the foreign cell for the local cell."
	This would be clearer if it included the account names, such
	as:
	/.../<local_cell>/sec/principal/krbtgt/foreign_account
	and
	/.../<foreign_cell>/sec/principal/krbtgt/local_account
	respectively.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	All of my technical reviewers pointed this sentence out as
	comical and somewhat condescending.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0269		tech	ComRef	1-210	man8dce/registry.8dce

	"You must have a permission to the replist."
	You must have the permissions required to create accounts.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0270		tech	ComRef	1-211	man8dce/registry.8dce

	The example that calls "getcellname" incorrectly includes a

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

Following is a list of various defects found in the object.8dce

moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially

	"An object represents a CDS object.  An object in the DCE
	Directory Service has a CDS name and associated attributes
	that are stored in CDS"
	This isn't very clear and the first sentence is a little
	simplistic.  Perhaps this is better worded, "An object
	represents an entity in CDS that has a name and attributes
	associated with it."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0231		form	ComRef	1-179	man8dce/object.8dce

	"Examples of object are an RPC serrpccp.cver entries..."
	This should say, "Examples of objects are RPC server

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	"...about which you want to see help information"
	The sentence is missing its . (period).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0233		tech	ComRef	1-182	man8dce/object.8dce

	The "object modify" example says that it is describing how to
	change an attribute value, but the example uses the "-add"
	option instead.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0234		typo	ComRef	1-182	man8dce/object.8dce

	"associated" is misspelled.

        A - (dash) is separated from the option name by a newline in
        the output.  In troff, this can be prevented by inserting a \
        (backslash) before the - (dash), which prevents the word from
        being broken over a newline.

        In the "cell backup" command description, steps 1 and 3 each
        contain a dcecp example that is too long to fit on one line.
        In dcecp commands, if you type a \ (backslash) at the end of a
        line, dcecp will continue the command on the next line with a
        ">" prompt.  In step 1, the ">" appears in the middle of the
        second line of the command and in step 3 it doesn't appear at
        all.  These examples should be fixed such that if a user types
        exactly what appears in the examples (including the
        backslash), the right thing will happen.

	The argument to the "-binding" option is listed as a
	"protocol_sequence_list."  This argument is more accurately
	called a "string_binding_list," since the command expects a
	string binding and the examples give a string binding.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The "host_address" argument is described as "A protocol
	sequence..." but it is really a string binding.

        A - (dash) is separated from the option name by a newline in

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing

        The square braces in the syntax line vary between being bold

        that you type literally, so its use would seem inappropriate
        for square braces, which indicate that something is optional.

                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

Status changed to dup.  Fixed by 13377.

[2/15/96 public]
Assigned to me. This CR will be addressed and resolved after I complete
the updates to the dcecp manpages that have been initiated internally
at HP.

Following is a list of various defects found in the dcecp.8dce
manpage by Maria Wadlow at Transarc and communicated to us here
at OSF. These defects are in the course of being fixed at this
moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially
register the changes...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0116            typo    ComRef  1-92    man8dce/dcecp.8dce

        "...metacharacters (for examply bu enclosing them in..."
        "example" and "by" are misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0117            form    ComRef  1-92    man8dce/dcecp.8dce

        "...dcecp returns 0 (zero) on success and 1 if a command..."
        The "0" and "1" should be bold.  Perhaps to be consistent the
        "1" should be displayed "1 (one)."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0118            tech    ComRef  1-92    man8dce/dcecp.8dce

        Is the "[info library]" reference ever described anywhere?
        This should be "dceshared/tcl."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0119            form    ComRef  1-92    man8dce/dcecp.8dce

        Is there some reason for the script name,
        "$dcecp_library/init.dcecp" to be indented, unlike the script
        names above and below it?  Also, why is "dceshared/dcecp"
        dereferenced through "$dcecp_library"?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0120            form    ComRef  1-92    man8dce/dcecp.8dce

        The square braces in the syntax line vary between being bold
        and not bold.  I believe the use of bold indicates something
        that you type literally, so its use would seem inappropriate
        for square braces, which indicate that something is optional.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0121            typo    ComRef  1-93    man8dce/dcecp.8dce

        "Specify options by preceeding the option name..."
        "preceding" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        "UUID's" should be "UUIDs" -- plural, not possessive.

        "It's value is a list of members to be added."
        "Its" is misspelled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        "The argument is a list of names of containers to return the
        children of."
        Perhaps this would be better phrased, "The argument is a list
        of names whose list of members should be returned."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0125            gramm   ComRef  1-95    man8dce/dcecp.8dce

        "If the user wants them sorted they should use:"
        Perhaps this would be better phrased, "If a sorted list is
        desired, use:"


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        "It is to be implemented for all objects that support
        replication."
        This should say, "It is implemented..."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0127            gramm   ComRef  1-95    man8dce/dcecp.8dce

        "If more than one instance name is given then each instance
        synchronizes, there is no relationship such as synchronize
        with each other, as this doesn't make sense for many objects."
        Perhaps this would be better phrased, "If more than one
        instance name is given then each instance synchronizes with
        all of its replicas.  There is no capability for pairwise
        synchronation."

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        currently can only be issued in this order:

        In the Synopsis and command descriptions, the commands are
        usually listed in alphabetic order.  Therefore, the "clock
        compare" command should appear before "clock help," not after

        The "-epoch" option takes an "epoch_number" argument.  Also,
        the "-abruptly" option and the "-epoch" option should be

Following is a list of various defects found in the clearinghouse.8dce
manpage by Maria Wadlow at Transarc and communicated to us here
at OSF. These defects are in the course of being fixed at this
moment; I'm entering them as a single CR in order to officially
register the changes...

        The "initiate," "repair," and "verify" subcommands exist but
        are not documented.  These subcommands don't work as the exist
        in the source, but were made to work by a developer here.  If
        they are fixed in the source, they should be documented.

        The "clearinghouse show" command also includes a [-schema]
        option that is not listed in the reference page.

        that contain..."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0096            tech    ComRef  1-65    man8dce/clearinghouse.8dce

        The descriptions of the clearinghouse counters are not very
        helpful.

                                1-68    man8dce/clearinghouse.8dce

        Suddenly the style has shifted to "write permission."  The
        previously-seen styles were: "c permission" and "control
        (c) permission."  These should be corrected to keep the style
        consistent throughout the document.

        The "catalog" operation is missing from this list.

        "...and counter information asociated with..."
        "associated" is misspelled twice (with the same context).

        The em-dash after the Privilege Required and Examples headings
        doesn't conform to the style of the rest of the document.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0105            tech    ComRef  1-68    man8dce/clearinghouse.8dce

        "If you specify a wildcard clearinghouse name, you also need
        read permission to the cell root directory."
        This is apparently leftover from cdscp, but is not applicable
        in dcecp.

        The font is wrong in the output of the second example of the
        "cdscache show" command.  It should be courier.  The font is
        also wrong in the "clearinghouse catalog" command example and
        in the "clearinghouse show" command example.

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

        "If omitted, `/.:' is the default."
        The use of single quotes here does not follow the style of the
        rest of the book.  Elsewhere, the single quotes would be
        omitted and the name would be bold.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
0086            typo    ComRef  1-59    man8dce/cell.8dce

        The string, "OSF DCE Administration Guide" was a hardwired
        reference and should have been a macro.

        In the "cell backup" command description, steps 1 and 3 each
        contain a dcecp example that is too long to fit on one line.
        In dcecp commands, if you type a \ (backslash) at the end of a
        line, dcecp will continue the command on the next line with a
        ">" prompt.  In step 1, the ">" appears in the middle of the
        second line of the command and in step 3 it doesn't appear at
        all.  These examples should be fixed such that if a user types
        exactly what appears in the examples (including the
        backslash), the right thing will happen.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        "(Refer to the cell object reference page for the required

        This is the cell page.  It probably shouldn't have an internal
        reference to itself.

        "It also requires the user to be authenticated to the dce
        security service as the cell administrator."
        There is no requirement that a cell have a cell administrator
        account.  This might be better worded, "It also requires that
        the administrator possess the privileges typically associated
        with the cell_admin account."

        "server_name_list"
        According to a developer who looked at the code, this is
        command can not actually handle a list, but can only handle a
        single name.  The description of the server_name_list argument
        should also be modified from "This is a list of one or more
        simple names for..." ("of" was misspelled) to "This is a
        simple name for..."  The description of the "cdscache delete"
        command should also be modified from "...argument is a list of
        one or more simple names given..." to "...argument is a simple
        name given..."  The description the "cdscache show" command
        should be similarly modified.

        to say, "Protocol sequences have a specific format that
        depends on the network address that is supplied in the

        the common Internet address notation."
        This shouldn't be so Internet-centric.  It would be more
        accurate to say, "The network-address is a string representing
        the network address of the server node."  Later, the phrase,

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

					and elsewhere

        There seem to be multiple styles used for describing the
        syntax of commands.

        I've seen all of the following used to describe optional,
        mutually exclusive options:
                1.  command [-a | -b]

                2.  command -a

                    command -b

                3.  command [[-a] | [-b]]

        I've seen required options listed with and without curly
        braces:
                1.  command {-a | -b}

                2.  command -a | -b

        And I have no idea what this is supposed to mean:
                1.  command arg_1 {[-a arg_a | arg_b]
                    [-c arg_c] [-d arg_d]}
        although I think, knowing the command (principal modify), that
	the author might have meant this instead:
                1a. command arg_1 {[-a {arg_a | arg_b}] |
                    [-c arg_c] | [-d arg_d]}

        It would be helpful to have a standard format for describing
        command syntax, a BNF or something equally unambiguous.

The dcecp specification (RFC42.3) list of changes (Section 1.1) lists the
following item which is not contained in the OSF DCE Command Reference:

       (cs) Modified description of `clock set' so that `-to' is optional.

[1/19/96 public]

In the text of the clock.8dce manpage included in the November
drop from HP, the (changed) text plainly states that the -to option
is required (as if to say, the original assertion of this CR is in-
correct). I'm leaving this bug open and reassigning it to Pam Millett,
who is about to do some further work on the manpages at HP.

[2/2/96 public]

The -to option is not required.  The usage of the command is

   clock set [dts_entity]
      {-to DTS_timestamp [-abruptly -epoch epoch_number] [-bypass] |
       -epoch epoch_number}

[2/28/96 public]

The conclusion from the above seems to be that this bug should
be cancelled. But I'm afraid to do that. So I'm "deferring" it
to 1.2.2 instead, and Pam can cancel it if she decides that's
the thing to do.

[2/29/96 public]

Doug, you were correct in leaving this bug open.  The usage of
the command is correct (as above), showing that when you use
'clock set' you can just change the epoch of a dts_entity by
using -epoch (without -to).

But in the body of the manpage, down in the 'clock set' part,
there is a sentence that begins "The required -to option...",
clearly stating -to is required.

When I put the usage comment on 2/2 I should also have stated that
it verified your comments of 1/19 and the body of the manpage was
incorrect.

We've fixed this in the manpage review Pam is applying now, so
it will go away soon.

            `dts' object to 5 minutes as per DCE CR 11089.

[1/19/96 public]

Well, I wasn't quite sure what to do here. There was some new material
for this passage in the November dcecp manpage drop from HP, which I
incorporated into the dts.8dce manpage (and marked the spot with .zA/
.zZ and the CR number); but the new material states the default as
being "0-00:15:00.000", whatever that means-- apparently not 5 minutes
(the previous value was "0-00:10:00.000"). ...By the way, as far as I
can see, the manpage nowhere states in what time-unit(s) the numerous
numeric values are expressed in-- which seems a defect to me.

So I have left this bug open, even though there is a change labelled with
its CR number in dts.8dce, and have reassigned it to Pam Millette, who is
about to do some further work on the manpages. She can both check what I've
already done and make whatever additions seem to be necessary.

Using CDS CDSCP commands, we do the following. (TEST_small is a user defined
attribute.)


cdscp create obj /.:/myobj
cdscp set obj /.:/myobj TEST_small = 1
cdscp remove obj /.:/myobj TEST_small = 1

Remove object gets an error, "Specified attribute type is incorrect."

Same thing happens with "dcecp object modify" command.

The Admin. Reference book says this command, "Removes a value from a set-valued
or single-valued attribute (including application-defined attributes) of an
 object entry."

The admin ref for "dcecp object modify" does not get into detailed discussion
about what to do. It refers to cdscp command ref page.

Pre DCE 1.0.2, it used to be that removing a value of a single-valued attribute
leaves the attribute value as <empty set>. OT 3525 later fixed this problem.

The current behavior (since 1.0.2) is

        * for single value attribute, you can only remove the attribute, not the
          value;

        * for multi-valued attributed, you can remove one value at a time, i
	  when you remove the last value, you will have a <empty set>.

Please update the man page for cdscp remove part to clarify the right syntax
for single-valued attribute and multi-valued attribute.

In the Rev. 1.0, copyright 1993 version of the DCE App Dev Ref,
the rpc_binding_set_auth_info man page declares the following:

               unsigned_char_t       **server_princ_name,

which should be fixed to reflect what exists in rpc.idl:

    [in]        unsigned_char_p_t       server_princ_name,

The DCE (1.0.3) Porting and testing guide (in the time section) mentions
the script test_dtscp_ultrix.sh which is suppsoed to be under 
src/test/time/control. This file does not exist in the code. 

Of course anything to do with ultrix does not exist any more. The doc 
should be modified.

I tried to see if the 1.1 doc has the same problem, but I don't see port_gd
under dcedoc-latest/dce-books/, although I do see it under
dcedoc-latest/Unused/src.old/.

So if port_gd will still be part of 1.1 doc, check it. Otherwise, cancel this
OT.

[6/10/94 public]
Charlie Brooks already opened a defect on this.
The dtscp_test_ultrix.sh file was replaced in 1.0.3

The following reference pages should be renamed such that they become
unique within each numeric section.

admin_ref/man4dfs/intro.4dfs      app_ref/man2dfs/intro.2dfs
admin_ref/man5sec/intro.5sec*     app_ref/man3dce/intro.3dce
admin_ref/man8cds/intro.8cds      app_ref/man3dfs/intro.3dfs

admin_ref/man8sec/intro.8sec      app_ref/man3xom/intro.3xom
app_ref/man1rpc/intro.1rpc        app_ref/man4xds/intro.4xds

I would recommend using a "intro_xyz" format, such that intro(3rpc) would
become intro_rpc(3rpc), and the file would be intro_rpc.3rpc.  However, I
could be convinced to use xyz_intro instead.  Whichever is chosen, it must
be used consistently.  This will provide us with more flexibility in
dealing with man systems that do not handle long section identifiers.

Please note that one page has had its file name changed to time_intro, but
the ref page calls itself just "intro(3dts)".  I think that the names on
the pages should be consistent with the file names.

There is not a man page for 'add mapping(8rpc)' in the RPC section
of the administration guide.

The usage is similar to the other add commands:
usage: rpccp add mapping [<options>] [host-address]

options:     a    <string>  annotation field
             b    <string>  string binding 		(required)
             i    <if id>   interface identifier 	(required)
             o    <uuid>    object identifier
             N              no replace

[9/15/93 public]

The rpccp add mapping(8rpc) man page appeared in the DCE 1.0.2
Release Notes. At DCE 1.0.2a, it was added to the Administration
Reference (man pages are bundled in the DCE Administration Reference, not
the DCE Administration Guide). However, a short description
of 'add mapping' still needs to be added to the section "DCE RPC
Administrative Facilities" in the Administration Guide/Core
Components volume (along with the other operations on endpoint
maps). I will open a new CR against the Administration Guide.

[9/14/95 public]

As far as I can tell, what used to be "add mapping" (for rpccp) is now
"endpoint create" (with dcecp). This is well documented in the Command
Ref, but only touched on in a way in the Guide. So this bug is officially
obsolete, though in fact maybe still apropos. At any rate, I'm reassigning
it to HP and they should take the next step.

App Dev Guide section 2.3.4 "Acquiring a Login Context" for server writers says
to do the following:
    sec_login_setup_identity()
    sec_key_mgmt_get_key()
    sec_login_validate_identity()
    sec_login_get_current_context()
The last call should be:
    sec_login_set_context()

Mike needs some new manuals.  This was fixed in the 1.0.2 doc set.  The 
original defect was closed by a submission made by Julie Buckler 1/27/93.

Full Description:

        pthread_attr_setprio man page says (in PARAMETERS section):

        "... To specify a priority midway between the minimum and maximum
        ....specify the following....:

        pri_rr_mid = (PRI_RR_MIN + PRI_RR_MAX)/2 "

        If I use this formula to get the default priority value from
        PRI_OTHER_MIN and PRI_OTHER_MAX then it falls 1 short of the correct
        value used in the code. The corrected equation should round-up the
        result, i.e.,

        pri_rr_mid = (PRI_RR_MIN + PRI_RR_MAX + 1)/2

Repeat By:

        Lookup the code, see if "default priority value" equals
        (PRI_OTHER_MIN + PRI_OTHER_MAX)/2 or not. It is one short.

	PRI_OTHER_MIN is set to 8, PRI_OTHER_MAX is set to 15 and the initial
	priority is set to cma_c_prio_through_mid, which is 12.


Proposed Solution:

        Replace:
                pri_rr_mid = (PRI_RR_MIN + PRI_RR_MAX)/2
        By:
                pri_rr_mid = (PRI_RR_MIN + PRI_RR_MAX + 1)/2

    <Note by kwalker (Ken Walker), 93/03/16 17:23:20, action: open>
On the man page for 'fts crserverentry', the following description
is wrong:
-principal name
        Specifies the abbreviation for the DFS server principal
        to be registered in the FLDB for the machine.  The machine's
        principal name in the Registry Database must match this
        name.
While coding the mkdfs command, we tried two different Registry
principals, neither of which worked:  'hosts/hostname/self' and
'hosts/hostname/dfs-server'.  What did work was work (and this
is what dce_config uses) was 'hosts/hostname', which is not a
Registry principal.
I don't know what is really meant here--I'll leave that to
Transarc or the DFS team to puzzle out.

The man page for "remove mapping" in the RPC section of the DCE Administration
Reference needs to remove the reference to the '-v' option.  This is not a
valid option to the remove mapping command.  See defect 2538 for more details
on this subject.

Scott Page Note from OT defect 8169 [page 06/17/93 public]:

I think the only outstanding problem listed in this defect (OT 8169) is 
the -v option in the rpccp remove mapping manpage (it should be removed).
rpccp has already been fixed.

see man page for rpc_binding_set_authn_info pg. 2-58 of the Application
Development reference where it states that when

rpc_binding_set_auth_info is called with

	protection level = none
        authentication service = dce secret
        authorization service = dce secret

return value is rpc_s_ok, although any subsequent rpc's performed will be
unathenticated. The documentation should point out that the triplet above
is just another way to ask for unathenticated not authenticated
service. This is because authentiacted rpc is not supported unless the
protection level is at leat connect. The documentation should describe the
impact of protection level on the availability of authenticated service.

Unfortunately, it doesn't work this way anymore.
The command is dfstrace.    You can get more
help by "dfstrace help".  Basically to get
a dump you "dfstrace dump " this will put the
output to stdout.  Also, the buffer sizes are
different for each platform.  OSF uses about
2k and AIX uses something much much larger.
The default behavior is to log cache manager
activity.  I am not sure if there are any other
options (like episode events, etc).
There are also some related hooks to make krpc
on the pmax to log its debugging events to the
dfstrace package.  Also, some of the dfs daemons
(dfsbind, flserver) will do user space logging
do a kill -30 <pid> to get them to dump their logs.
Maybe Eliott can elaborate on the not so obvious
things.

  Thanks for the reminder to add this note.
  The man page for sec_rgy_pgo_get_members does not describe that the
passed domain may be 'sec_rgy_domain_person', in which case the routine
will attempt to return the grouplist for that principal. A look at the
code (rs_pgo.c) would indicate that this is supported, and this routine
is used for this purpose within rgy_edit . Is this an oversight in the
documentation, or is this truly an unsupported feature of this routine
and one which we should not rely upon? 
  I am raising this defect as one of our customers has a use for it in
determining the group set for a principal who has no valid account.

[4/1/93 public]
This is in fact a doc bug.  The functionality is supported - performing
this operation on a principal will return the set of groups that the
principal is a member of.  Note that this is different from the
"projlist" (or what should be set in the unix concurrent groupset
since this function will return all groups (that you can know about)
as opposed to only those groups that have been annotated as OK for
inclusion in the concurrent groupset.  (for the latter use the
sec_rgy_acct_get_proj;list function).

  The function sec_key_mgmt_manage_key() should not return with status
"registry server unavailable". Ideally, the routine would continue to
retry in hopes of finally reaching the server.
  This routine must have access to the (singular) master registry
server, agreed, and as such there will be windows of unavailablity.
The key manager should mask these windows from the application, and
never return due to rgy bind failures. By sleeping not until the
expected key expiration date, but until some large (in human
terms) interval prior to expiration, it can give the application a
window in which key management can be retried. This would make it far
less prone to service outage windows.
  A future enhancement to increase serviceability would be to have
sec_clientd check access to a master registry periodically, and inform
(via syslogd?) an adminstrator of perceived rgy service outages. The
operator could then take action to correct the problem; applications
using key management would ride out the outage by retrying for an
interval, during which timely corretive action would bring the rgy
service back, or shut the dependent application down softly if required.

sec_key_mgmt_manage_key is supposed to return an error if it can't do what
you told it to (if it can't talk to a registry to update the key, note that
calls to the registry retry implicitly).  You are free to wait for whatever
time period you like and try again (presumably printing an error message or
updating an audit log or whatever your server wants to do to note the problem).
If we made it just keep trying, it may sit there forever doing nothing and
you wouldn't know about it, because it didn't return an error and you're not
allowed to print errors or warnings from inside a library routine.  This defect
is cancelled.

[12/3/92 public]
  Mike, there's a strong reaction here to this cancellation. I'm
reopening this defect.
  If the key manager cannot bury transient failures from the
application's view, then it must, minimally, include the following in
the documentation:
1 - complete list of possible return values
      applications will need to know what to expect,
      in order to best handle the return of this routine
2 - classification of return values by correct reaction e.g.
      soft failure (application may progress by retrying)
      hard failure (retries useless e.g. malloc failure)
3 - recommendations (for each return code) for application's proper reaction
  The existing function description states that this routine will return
values which do not include the registry unavailable code (in particular) in
case of failure. It was surmised by developers here that the routine
would, then, not fail due to server outage.
  The existing man page should definitely change to indicate that this
routine's return is far from inevitable, and that certain returns
may indicate the need for external action (e.g. reconnect a wire to the
registry daemon).

Changed Status from `cancel' to `open'

[12/3/92 public]
It's not that it CAN'T bury transient failures, it's that it would be WRONG
to bury transient failures, because then nobody using this API would be able
to tell if there was a problem even if they wanted to.  If your complaint is
that the documentation doesn't tell you about every error that it may return,
(as your last comment above seems to say) then this is a doc bug.  I've changed
this from 'code' to 'doc'.

[12/8/92 public]
I've changed this CR to dup of 5250.  CR 5250 specifies that the 
error messages should be more thoroughly documented in message/cause/action 
format.  I think this covers this bug, but if I am wrong, please  change it's 
status back to open and supply more specific details of what should be 
changed.  CR5250 has been deferred until after 1.0.2.

Full Description:

When sec_login_import_context(3sec) is called with the name
of an exportable login context which has not been "finalized"
by a call to sec_login_set_context(3sec), sec_login_import_context(3sec)
will return sec_login_s_no_current_context (which translates to
the following message).

"No currently established network identity for which context exists (dce /
sec)"

This possiblillity is not listed in the ERRORS section of the
sec_login_import_context.

Proposed Solution:

Correct the documentation to include this error message.

[7/28/92 public]
assigned to writer and defered to 1.0.2

[10/19/92 public]
Made this a dup of code bug 4851, since when that defect is fixed for 1.0.2,
this will no longer be a problem (that status will no longer be returned),
so you won't need to document it.

[7/6/95 public]

Reassigning this for DCE 1.2. 4851 is still open.
