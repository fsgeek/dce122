DCE R1.2.2 Quality and Testing Report
=====================================

This document reviews the original quality criteria defined for DCE R1.2.2
and describes the level of compliance to those criteria by the final DCE
R1.2.2 components. It also covers testing results as part of review of
quality criteria.

Detailed information referred to in this report can be found on the release
media within several archives (i.e., dce, ode, doc, project).
Refer to Chapter 3 of the DCE 1.2.2  Release Notes for a complete
description of these archives.  For example, Test Plans, Test Logs, and OT
reports are available in an archive called "project". The directories of
this archive include:
 o defect.summary (content of the project OT defect dbase at time of shipment),
 o test.results (the log files of all tests run),
 o test.plans (functional test plans for new 1.2.2 functionality).


The overall quality criteria was: "The quality of R1.2.2 must be better
than or equivalent to R1.2.1."  

The data that was tracked and measured over the course of the project supports
compliance with this overall quality criteria.

The entire R1.2.2 development process supported this overall quality
criteria, both at the DCE provider sites, as well as at OSF:

Core integration, as managed by Hewlett-Packard, Digital and IBM was done
feature-at-a-time at Hewlett-Packard (HP).   That is, only one feature or
set of bug fixes was allowed into the HP code base at a time.  After
submission, all functional tests were executed, and then all system tests
(including the Continuous Hours of Operation (CHO) reliability tests) were
executed.  Any regressions were fixed immediately - no subsequent code
submission could be made until all regressions were addressed.  Also, prior
to any submission, the code being submitted needed to be tested in
isolation (either at HP, Digital or IBM) to demonstrate the integrity of
the code.  This included running new tests against the new functionality as
well as any relevent regression tests.

DFS integration, as managed by Transarc, was a step-by-step process,
accelerated by the use of Transarc's product code.  That is, all R1.2.2 DFS
features being submitted directly to OSF by Transarc were product quality,
and previously tested thoroughly by Transarc's product teams on Solaris.
An initial phase of testing was completed on the R1.2.2 reference platform
(AIX) using an early version of the Core, and finally, the last phase of
testing was completed against the frozen R1.2.2 Core.

DFA Regression Testing, as completed by Hitachi, was conducted three times
over the course of the project. This level of testing was suitable considering 
that no new DFA functionality was added in R1.2.2.

Base level builds were completed at OSF seven times over the course of the
project.  The first four baselevels reflected submissions of Core
functionality as well as a handful of DFA bug fixes; the fifth, all DFS
functionality; the sixth, critical core bug fixes plus the final Public Key
functionality; and the seventh, a second DFS code submission (bug fixes
only).  Functional testing was required to be completed for any new
functionality prior to submission to the OSF code base.  Also, any
outstanding defects in the code submission were required to be logged in
the OT data base.  Then, integration testing was performed on the code base
as it existed at OSF.

The seven submissions to the OSF code base allowed for tracking and
monitoring of the specific project quality criteria.

The specific criteria and the associated detailed assessment follows:

************************************************************************
1.)
CRITERIA: All functionality (code and tests) have been delivered in working
order and with sufficient documentation (specs and end-user docs).
************************************************************************

This criteria was met.

This criteria insured that each Provider supplied documented, completed and
tested functionality to OSF.  This criteria measured the completeness of
the project.  A project deliverables list was monitored - all deliverables
(source, tests, documentation, logs, RFCs, etc.) were tracked in terms of 
their planned submission/availability date.

- End User Documentation was completed. The functionality added for 
DCE R1.2.2 has been documented for its end-users -- administrators 
and applications developers.  Additionally, the overall documentation 
has been improved (through Provider reviews), and the docset has been
migrated to a more interchangeable format (SGML).  This migration required 
substantial cleanup of the converted source.  All content from the original 
source has been captured; but some cleanup was not completed in the 
GDS Administration Guide and Reference.  

- Functional Specifications and Test and Project Plans were all delivered.
Recording, monitoring and reporting the availability of complete and
accurate specifications verified compliance to the specification
portion of this quality criteria.  Functional Specifications (RFCs) can be 
found on the release media in an archive labeled "doc", within a subdirectory 
labeled "DCE1.2_specs"; Test Plans can be found on the release media in an 
archive called "project", within  a subdirectory labeled "test.plans".

- Descriptions of all functionality delivered in R1.2.2 can be found within 
the "doc" archive, at DCE1.2_specs, in RFC 63.3, Section 4.  Excluded 
functionality included "Improvements to CDS", specifically, "CDS Backend 
rewrite" (scope of work posed risk to the schedule and was low priority 
functionality) and "POSIX pathconf API" compliance (demand for this requirement
 proved to be minimal).  The combination of diligent project management, 
formal submission guidelines, regularly scheduled integration, and build and 
smoke-test cycles at OSF verified that the code was delivered in good working 
order. Results (test logs) of Functional and System Testing performed before 
the submission of functionality to the OSF can be found on the release media 
in an archive called "project", within  a subdirectory labeled "test.results".   This subdirectory also contains the results of smoke testing performed at OSF 
on the final software submissions.
 
- All Tests specified within each Provider's Test Plan were delivered in
source form, along with logs showing the results of their execution prior
to code submission.   The source of Tests can be found on the release media
in an archive called "dce", within  a subdirectory labeled "test".  Test
logs  can be found on the release media in an archive called "project",
within  a subdirectory labeled "test.results".


************************************************************************
2.)
CRITERIA: Functional Verification Test (FVT) & System Test Suites Passed
************************************************************************

This criteria was met.

New functional tests as well as existing functional tests and system tests
were used to confirm that new functionality was functionally complete,
worked as specified, and caused no regression in reliability of previous
functionality.

During the Test Planning phase, OSF along with each Provider cooperatively
selected the group of tests that delivered the best test coverage within
the allocated amount of test time. Each Provider's Test Plan lists all FVTs
and System Tests selected during the planning phase. An audit of 1.2.2 Test
Reports and Test Logs showed that 1.) all planned FVT and System Tests were
indeed run 2.) additional System Tests (e.g,Sec Rep tests) were run and 
3.) all DCE V1.1 Core FVTs were run with the exception of a few that were 
either replaced with improved tests (e.g.,perf,v2,gsa) or technical 
difficulties prevented their use (e.g.,I18N).

The overwhelming majority of Core and DFS 1.2.2 functional verification
tests passed, demonstrating no regressions from 1.2.1. A review of 1.2.2
Test Logs showed that where a few failures existed, the majority were
caused by the tests themselves. Wherever a test type failure occurred, it
was noted in the Provider's Test Report and referenced by a corresponding
defect database (OT) number.

Individual Test Reports are available within the "project" archive in
the "TestSummary" file

A.) Functional Verification Testing (FVT) Type Testing:
Functional Verification Testing proved that all new features and
functionality performed reliably and that no regression occurred.

DFA Results
============

Because no new functionality was added in R1.2.2, this test criteria was not 
applicable to DFA.



CHO Tests (48 hours)

As one measure of system reliability, each major component must operate 48
hours continuously while under a moderate load induced by the repetitive
execution of a group of system tests.

This goal was met.  

The Core, DFS and DFA successfully ran (ie., all planned tests were run) for 
minimally 48 continuous hours.  

Test logs, from Core, DFS and DFA CHO testing, can be found in the "project"
archive within the test.results/CHO subdirectory.

Core Results
===========

Throughout development, Core functionality continuously exceeded the 48hr. 
CHO goal. At one time, Core CHO tests ran continuously for up to 91+ hours, 
before being deliberately interrupted in order to perform other testing.

DFS Results
==========

DFS met this criteria using the following test scenerio in which all tests
ran successfully for 48 continuous hours:

dfs.glue
dfs.lock
dfs.read_write_all.main
dfs.repfs  


DFA Results
===========

DFA met this criteria using the following test scenerio in which all tests
ran successfully for 48 continuous hours:

login/out 48CHO batch file (login48.bat)
file access 48CHO batch file (access48.bat)
filer 48CHO batch file (filer48.bat)

The content of each .bat file can be found within the TestSummary document,
located within the "project" archive.

************************************************************************
3.)
CRITERIA: Address all "CRITICAL" defects
************************************************************************

All "CRITICAL" (i.e., A0, A1, B0, B1) defects needed to be addressed
(e.g., either fixed in source, fixed in the OT, blocked from occurring by
an acceptable workaround, deferred or sufficiently documented).

As expected, this criteria was not met.

This expectation was set early on in the implementation phase after a thorough 
examination of all unresolved CRITICAL OTs (66). Each Provider initially 
selected a number of OTs that they felt were in need of resolution by R1.2.2; 
the owner of each applicable OT then had the opportunity to calculate the cost 
of compliance.   At this point, it was possible to negotiate the level of 
planned compliance.  It was evident that available resources were insufficient
to address "all" CRITICAL OTS.  Furthermore, several of the OTs were in the
area of H-cells; the risk involved to resolve these problems was too great to
the R1.2.2 schedule. 

Nevertheless, those components that did meet this goal (i.e, had no OTs with
status = OPEN) include aud, dts, dfs, and dfa; aud, dfs, and dfa were 
improvements upon R1.2.1.  Of the eight non-conforming components (i.e, had OTs with status = OPEN), dcecp, cds, sec, utils and thr reduced their number of
OPEN CRITICALS when compared to R1.2.1 GA.  The following tables depict the
improved cumulative content (CRITICAL only) of the DCE defect database at time 
of R1.2.2. shipping.  Full descriptions of all OTs are available within the 
"project" archive at defect.summary.

("UNRESOLVED" includes OTs with type "defect" only [does not include 
"enhancement" type] and status of either OPEN or DEFERRED.)

When compared, cumulative R1.2.2 critical type defects were less than R1.2.1
in 6 cases, 3 remained the same and 3 components were slightly greater.

The following table depicts the status of all CRITICAL code defects at the 
time of R1.2.2 GA:

4.)
CRITERIA: Overall Defect Density Ratio Less Than 0.3
Defect Density Ratio Per Component of Less Than or Equal to 0.3
************************************************************************

One criteria was for the overall defect density ratio per thousand lines of
code (KLOC) to be less than 0.3.

The other criteria was for the defect density ratio for each DCE component
to be 0.3 or better. However, the Core Provider sought and received a
waiver for a portion of this criteria.  After considering the schedule
along with promised functionality and available resources, the Core
Provider committed to meeting defect density levels of dced(.79), sec(.48),
thr(.73), and utils(.61).

Overall, R1.2.2 met the defect density criteria.

On the per "component measurement", R1.2.2 is an improvement upon R1.2.1.

Eight R1.2.2 components (dfs,utils,rpc,aud,dfa,sec,gds,dcecp) met the defect
density per component goal, four did not (utils,thr,dced,dts); adjusted Core 
goals produced two (sec and utils) of the conforming components.

This is an improvement compared to DCE R1.2.1, where five components met this 
criteria, seven did not (dced,utils,aud,sec,cds,thr,dts).

5.)
CRITERIA: All new component's segment and API code coverage were to be
reported.
************************************************************************

The intention of this criteria is to provide a measurement of the level of
functional testing being accomplished regarding all new code's API and
segment coverage.  The measurement delivers the actual level of testing
adequacy as well as identifies areas needing improvement over time.  The
target was all APIs were to be called once (100% API coverage) and segment
coverage to be at least 60%.

The R1.2.2 Project Team identified alternative ways of supplying the level
of functional testing being accomplished.  If not using an automated code
coverage tool, then one of the following was to be used:

  - manual tracing of code or,
  - test plan review, where test plans have details about test cases or,
  - test case review/inspections by Providers or,
  - a combination of the above.

The methods chosen are summarized here:

DFS:    The Provider's DFS testing techniques were detailed within their
Test Plans.  DFS Test Plans for new functionality clearly state that all
new code paths are tested by test suites.

DFA: Were excluded because of the absence of new functionality (however, it
is expected that code coverage in R1.2.2 is essentially the same as in R1.2.1).
The TestSummary file, contained in the "project" archive, includes full R1.2.1
code coverage results for dfa.

CORE: In addition to test plan reviews, data via the PureCoverage and Vista 
tools was provided, with the exception of PKSS & Certification API (that 
either used their respective Test Plans to detail the coverage rates obtained 
via manual tracing, or, performed test case review/inspections).

The summary results of Core code coverage for new functionality are included 
in the next section.  The TestSummary file, contained in the "project" archive,
contains full R1.2.2 segment and API code coverage results.


Component            Segment Coverage         API Coverage
pkss                         85%                      100%

The Provider computed that approximately 4800+ lines of code were added for
PKSS.  Test case review/inspections determined that about 85% of the code
is tested.  The tests exercise all of the RPC's, determined by manual
inspection (GREP through the files).  All "good" paths are tested. Some
error paths are not explicitly tested because it wasn't cost (time)
effective.

The pkss Provider met this quality criteria.


Component               Coverage               Segment Coverage
Cert API		  100%                          100%

The Provider performed manual Test case review/inspections that determined
that all APIs are called via tests at least once.

The Cert API Provider met this quality criteria. 


************************************************************************
6.)
CRITERIA: All existing component's segment and API code coverage must be
greater than or equal to what was in the previous release.
************************************************************************

The goal is to continue to provide a measurement of the level of functional
testing being accomplished and assist with improvement of the adequacy of
testing over time.  Minimally, the results must be equal to those of
the previous relase.

This criteria was not met by all components.  

Allowable exceptions to this criteria follow:

1.) DFA:  The work in R1.2.2 consisted of fixing defects only and delivering
new tests for each fix.   It was agreed, therefore, to forego a new round of
manual code coverage measurements.  This decision appears reasonable when
considering that 1,764 LOC were added to the DFA R1.2.1 base, which is <3%
of the current DFA code base.   Additionally, the new tests delivered
augmented previous test coverage.  The results of R1.2.1 DFA Code Coverage
are available within the "TestSummary" file of the project archive.

2.) DFS:  Portions of DFS reside in the kernel and cannot be measured by either
the Veritas or Pure Coverage Tools.  Resource issues (time and people)
prevented measuring the portions not residing in the kernel.  However, this
Provider's testing techniques plus test plan reviews suggested that sufficient
testing was being accomplished.

3.) CDS: The work in R1.2.1 and R1.2.2 consisted of fixing defects only. It 
was agreed that the coverage numbers from R1.1 would provide a fair overall 
representation.

A summary of R1.2.2 Core code coverage results follows.  The TestSummary file, 
contained in the "project" archive, contains full R1.2.2 segment and API code 
coverage results.

In summary, of the six major Quality criteria: #1 & #2 were clearly met
and #3 thru #6 were partially met.  The data indicates that a reliable
product has been provided but attention needs to be applied to enhancing 
test suites to improve code coverage.
