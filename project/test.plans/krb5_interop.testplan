        Test Plan : Manual interoperability testing of DCE 1.2 & krb5
        -------------------------------------------------------------

0. Overview

    This is a live document.  This document will be extended with any
    changes or additions as the testing is being performed.  The
    intention is to use this as the basis for documenting the manual
    tests for krb5 interoperability in the DCE 1.2.2 Portability and
    Testing Guide, or release notes.

1. Introduction

    This document describes the goals and steps required of the manual
    testing for DCE 1.2 & krb5 interoperability.

2. Goals

    The goal of this effort is to verify the requirements against 2
    commercial versions of Kerberos.  More specifically:

        a) Test that the DCE 1.2.2 Security Server can act as a Kerberos
        KDC for 2 commercial versions of Kerberos V5 clients.

        b) Test that a DCE 1.2.2 client and 2 commercial versions of
        Kerberos V5 clients can coexist together on the same host.

        c) Test that the DCE 1.2.2 secure BSD remote utilities can
        interoperate with 2 commercial versions of Kerberos V5 secure
        BSD remote utilities.

3. Hardware Requirements

    one IBM workstation running AIX 3.2.5 Patch level E4R9 or higher.
    one HP-UX workstation running HP-UX 9.05.
    one HP-UX workstation running HP-UX 10.01.

4. Software Requirements

    DCE 1.2.2 built for AIX, including the rutils.
    2 commercial versions of Kerberos V5 clients:
        a) CyberSafe
        b) HP Secure Internet Services - (only includes krb5 remote
        utilities)

5. Configuration Steps

    First configure the AIX workstation with a DCE 1.2.2 Security and
    CDS Server.

    Install the CyberSafe Krb5 client software on the HPUX 9.05
    workstation.  Refer to chapter 3 of the release notes.  Copy the
    krb.conf & krb.realm (in /krb5) files from the AIX DCE Security
    Server to the HP-UX client.  Complete the final configuration steps
    in Chapter 3 (p.  18).

    Next install the Secure Internet Services on the HP-UX workstation
    running HP-UX 10.01.

6. Additional Setup

    On the DCE Security Server, add a test user account (test_user).
    Allow the test user to obtain forwardable, proxiable & renewable
    tickets.

    The DCE 1.2.2 dce_config script automatically sets up the required
    configuration for the rutils. However, you will need to perform some
    additional manual steps for the CyberSafe and HP SIS clients.

    For the CyberSafe and HP SIS client, create a
    "host/{fully-qualified-hostname}" account in the DCE registry and a
    key in /krb5/v5srvtab.

    Copy the /krb5/v5srvtab file to the 2 client machines.

7. Manual Tests

    A. DCE KDC Interoperability

        From the CyberSafe Krb5 client, execute the following:

        a) kinit as test_user to get a TGT. Check with klist.
        b) kinit -f as test_user to get a forwardable TGT. Check with
           klist -f.
        c) kinit -p as test_user to get a proxiable TGT. Check with
           klist -f.
        d) kinit -r as test_user to get a renewable TGT. Check with
           klist -f.
        e) kdestroy. Check that creds are destroyed with klist.
        f) execute the kdc5_hammer test (comes with Cybersafe
           installation) in /krb5/tests
        g) kinit as bogus user
        h) kinit as test_user with wrong password.

        Also, the rutil interop tests will test mutual authentication,
        ticket forwarding, and other requirements.

    B. Remote Utility Interoperability

        The following table displays each of the required
        interoperability scenarios to be tested:

                            Server
                 | DCE 1.2.2   | CyberSafe     | HP SIS
        --------------------------------------------------------
        DCE 1.2.2 |    No       |       Yes     |       Yes
Client  CyberSafe |    Yes      |       No      |       No
        HP SIS    |    Yes      |       No      |       No

        For each scenario, the following tests need to be executed:

        a) rsh and rshd interoperate:

            1. rsh [remote_host] pwd
            2. forward creds: rsh -f [remote host] klist
            3. encryption: rsh -x [remote host] pwd
               (encryption not supported by HP SIS)
            4. encryption & forwarding: rsh -fx [remote host] klist
            5. Deny access via .k5login, /krb5/aname.

        b) rlogin and rlogind interoperate:

            1. rlogin [remote_host]; pwd
            2. forward creds: rlogin -f [remote host]; klist
            3. encryption: rlogin -x [remote host]; pwd
               (encryption not supported by HP SIS)
            4. encryption & forwarding: rlogin -fx [remote host]; klist
            5. Deny access via .k5login, /krb5/aname.
            6. forwardable creds: rlogin -F [remote host]; then on
               remote host, rlogin -f [remote host2]; klist

        c) Additional tests as time permits:

            1. test bogus user
            2. test -l option of rsh, rlogin
            3. rlogin: test CTRL-S, CTRL-Q, "~.", "~^D", "~^Z",
               "~^Y", "~!"
            4. rlogin: change window size, check baud rate (stty -a),
               try vi,emacs editors.
            5. rsh: test command that requires stdin, interrupt long
               running command.

    C. DCE/krb5 client coexistence

        Copy the /krb5/bin binaries to the DCE Security Server.  Test
        the following scenarios:

        Edit /opt/dcelocal/dce_cf.db.  Test the following 2 scenarios
        with krb5_ccache_vno set to 1 & 2.

        a. Acquire a TGT with the DCE kinit.  klist the creds file with
           the krb5 klist.  klist the creds file with the DCE klist.
           Refresh the creds file with the krb5 kinit.  Destroy the
           creds file with the krb5 kdestroy.

        b. Acquire a TGT with the krb5 kinit.  klist the creds file with
           the DCE klist.  klist the creds file with the krb5 klist.
           Refresh the creds file with the DCE kinit.  Destroy the creds
           file with the DCE kdestroy.

        Edit /opt/dcelocal/dce_cf.db.  Test the following 2 scenarios
        with krb5_kt_vno set to 1 & 2

        a. Create a keytab file with DCE dcecp.  Insert a key into this
           keytab with DCE dcecp.

        b. Create a keytab file with kadmin 'genkt' command.  Display
           using DCE dcecp.
