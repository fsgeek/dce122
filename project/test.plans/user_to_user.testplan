                Test Plan : DCE 1.2.2 User to User Protocol
                -------------------------------------------

0. Overview

    This is a live document.  This document will be extended with any
    changes or additions as the testing is being performed.  The
    intention is to use this as the basis for documenting the existing
    and new/modified tests for User to User, in the DCE 1.2.2 Portability
    and Testing Guide, or release notes.

1. Introduction

    This document describes the goals and steps required of the testing
    of DCE 1.2.2 User to User functionality.

2. Goals

    Verify that the new functionality do not cause regression.

    Verify that the new u2u protocol works for both DG and CN.

    Verify that the new dcecp functionality works.

3. Hardware Requirements

    IBM workstation running AIX 3.2.5 Patch level E4R9 or higher.
    or
    HP-UX workstation running HP-UX 9.05.

4. Software Requirements

    DCE 1.2.2 built for AIX version listed above, or HPUX 9.05.

5. Configuration Steps

    Configure a simple one or more system test cell.

6. Integrated Tests

    The existing functional test suite has been and will be used to
    ensure that the new code does not cause regression in the existing,
    non user to user protocols.

    The following dcecp functional tests have been modified to test the
    new dcecp account -usertouser functionality:

    account_create_N.tcl
    account_create_P.tcl
    account_modify_N.tcl
    account_modify_P.tcl

7. Manual Tests

    The existing test for the purpose of testing keytab based server
    registration and authenticated RPCs is the PERF client/server in:

    src/test/rpc/runtime/perf

    It still requires manual running, but is fairly well known, widely
    used and is well described by its help output and by

    src/test/rpc/runtime/perf/README

    This test has been extended, and the README file updated, to allow
    running the server with User to User based registration.  The
    instructions in the README file will describe how to set up the test
    to verify ticket refreshes, and to verify the protocol over both
    RPC CN and RPC DG transports.
